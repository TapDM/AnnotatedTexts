Here we show that two Neurospora crassa genes <br />           whose protein products share similarity to known HSFs play different biological roles. We report that heat <br />           shock factor 1 (hsf1) is an essential gene and that hsf2 is required for asexual development. Conidiation may be <br />           blocked in the hsf2 knockout (hsf2KO) strain because HSF2 is an integral element of the conidiation pathway <br />           or because it affects the availability of protein chaperones. We report that genes expressed during conidiation, <br />           for example fluffy, conidiation-10, and repressor of conidiation-1 show wild-type levels of expression in a hsf2KO <br />           strain. However, consistent with the lack of macroconidium development, levels of eas are much reduced. <br />           Cultures of the hsf2KO strain along with two other aconidial strains, the fluffy and aconidial-2 strains, took <br />           longer than the wild type to recover from heat shock. Altered expression profiles of hsp90 and a putative <br />           hsp90-associated protein in the hsf2KO strain after exposure to heat shock may <span id='am-101' about='ncbitaxon:in_part' typeof='owl:Thing'>in part</span> account for its reduced <br />           ability to cope with heat stress. <br />  <br />  <br />    The heat shock response is a protective mechanism against                   mRNA which encode HSF isoforms with different transcrip- <br /> sudden temperature change and other forms of physical and                      tional activities (16).

In addition, several recently gen-    <br /> erated knockout strains have been recorded as aconidial, in-                                               <br /> cluding strains with mutations in vegetative growth and asexual          <br /> development (the vad-2 [LGI] and vad-4 [LGIII] strains). hsf1              <br /> and hsf2 are both located on LGII, separated by approximately            <br /> 100 kbp, and do not map to any of the previously described                 <br /> aconidial mutants. Bailey-Shrode and Ebbole place acon-2 up-              <br /> stream of fl and acon-3 in the pathway to conidiation (1). In          <br /> this scheme, fl regulates acon-3 and eas, a gene encoding a                <br /> hydrophobin found on the surfaces of macroconidia (3, 24),              <br /> while acon-3 regulates con-6 and con-10. The rco-1 gene prod-            <br /> uct represses the expression of eas, con-6, and con-10 (50, 26,       <br /> 1). We were interested to find out if HSF2 is an integral               <br /> element of the proposed pathway or whether it acts as a facil-       <br /> itator ensuring that the necessary chaperones are present to                 <br /> ensure the correct conformation of pathway components.                <br />    After initiation of development induced by the transfer of             <br /> cultures to medium lacking nitrogen we found, in agreement          <br /> with previous reports, that fl transcript levels in the wild type             <br /> increase after 6 hours (1). fl is a transcriptional activator and a          <br /> major regulator of conidiation in Neurospora (1, 39), whose                 <br /> expression has previously been reported to be low in the acon-2            <br /> strain (1). However, we found that fl was increased in all three            <br /> aconidial strains, data which suggest that ACON2 regulates                 <br /> some posttranscriptional aspect of fl gene expression. In keep-              <br /> ing with the lack of spore formation in the acon-2 and fluffy             <br /> mutants, levels of con-10 are low in these strains. With the                <br /> exception of eas, and the higher levels of fl at 6 h, all of the           <br /> transcripts assayed throughout development showed similar                 <br /> levels of expression in the hsf2 and wild-type strains.                      <br />    One scenario that could account for the aconidial phenotype              <br /> </body></html>
