The ability to replicate within <br />                                         macrophages relies on the tightly regulated expression of a series of genes. One of the most <br />                                         commonly used means of coordinating the regulation of multiple genes in bacteria consists of the <br />                                         association of dedicated alternative sigma factors with the core of the RNA polymerase (RNAP). In <br />                                         silico analysis of the F. tularensis LVS genome led us to identify, in addition to the genes encoding <br />                                         the RNAP core (comprising the a1, a2, b, b9 and v subunits), one gene (designated rpoD) encoding <br />                                         the major sigma factor s70, and a unique gene (FTL_0851) encoding a putative alternative sigma <br />                                         factor homologue of the s32 heat-shock <span id='am-30' about='obo:NCBITaxon_family' typeof='owl:Thing NCBITaxon:_taxonomic_rank'><span id='am-31' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-32' property="rdfs:label" content="family" datatype="xsd:string"></span>family</span> (designated rpoH).

The search parameters and input sequences were         encoding the F. tularensis rpoH gene (pBADrpoH) under <br /> adjusted until the motif identified corresponded to the previously          the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter.

Identification of       showing that F. tularensis rpoH can functionally <br /> putative RpoH-binding sites was accomplished in two steps. First,           complement the lack of s32 in E. coli.
