The most studied gene responsible for DC pathogenesis is DKC1 while mutations in several other genes encoding <br />      components of the H/ACA RNP telomerase complex, which is involved in ribosomal RNA(rRNA) processing and telomere <br />      maintenance, have also been implicated. GAR1/nola1 is one of the four core proteins of the H/ACA RNP complex. Through <br />      comparative analysis of morpholino oligonucleotide induced knockdown of dkc1 and a retrovirus insertion induced <br />      mutation of GAR1/nola1 in zebrafish, we demonstrate that hematopoietic defects are specifically recapitulated in these <br />      models and that these defects are significantly reduced in a p53 null mutant background. We further show that changes in <br />      telomerase activity are undetectable at the early stages of DC pathogenesis but rRNA processing is clearly defective.
