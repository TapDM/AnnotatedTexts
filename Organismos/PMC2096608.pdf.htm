Centralspindlin, but not its individual subunits, is sufficient to bundle microtubules in vitro. Here, we <br /> present a biochemical and genetic dissection of centralspindlin. We show that each of the two subunits of centralspindlin <br /> dimerize via a parallel coiled coil. The two homodimers assemble into a high-affinity heterotetrameric complex by virtue <br /> of two low-affinity interactions. Conditional mutations in the regions that mediate complex assembly can be readily <br /> suppressed by numerous second site mutations in the interacting regions. <span id='am-21' about='obo:NCBITaxon_169495' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_33340 obo:NCBITaxon_33213 obo:NCBITaxon_169440 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_7147 obo:NCBITaxon_43733 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_43738 obo:NCBITaxon_480117 obo:NCBITaxon_33317 obo:NCBITaxon_169449 obo:NCBITaxon_480118 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_6072 obo:NCBITaxon_6960 obo:NCBITaxon_43750 obo:NCBITaxon_33208 obo:NCBITaxon_85512 obo:NCBITaxon_197562 obo:NCBITaxon_197563 obo:NCBITaxon_7203 obo:NCBITaxon_6656 obo:NCBITaxon_7496 obo:NCBITaxon_1206794 obo:NCBITaxon_88770 obo:NCBITaxon_33392 obo:NCBITaxon_169455 obo:NCBITaxon_50557 obo:NCBITaxon_43741'><span id='am-22' property="rdfs:label" content="This" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-23' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-24' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-25'  ></span>This</span> unexpected plasticity explains the lack of <br /> primary sequence conservation of the regions critical for this essential protein&#8211;protein interaction. <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                           (Mollinari et al., 2002, 2005; Kurasawa et al., 2004; Verbrug- <br />                                                                        ghe and White, 2004; Verni et al., 2004) <span id='am-67' about='ncbitaxon:in_part' typeof='owl:Thing'>in part</span> through the <br /> Cell division in animal cells is dependent upon a structure            ability of this factor to bind to the kinesin-4 motor protein <br /> known as the central spindle.

Simple transgenic arrays marked by rol-6(su1006) were prepared and the efficiency <br /> of zen-4 D520N and D735N versus wt ZEN-4 to rescue zen-4(w35) was assayed. The rescue efficiency was scored by counting the blistered <br /> [bli-6(sc16)] animals, both at the restrictive (25&#176;C; gray) and the permissive temperature (16&#176;C; black) as described previously (Mishima et al., <br /> 2004). At 25&#176;C ZEN-4 D520N could not rescue the null, whereas both wt and ZEN-4 D735N efficiently rescued the null. (B) The D520N point <br /> mutation in zen-4(or153ts) inhibits MT bundling. MT bundling assays were performed with constituents of centralspindlin alone, and with <br /> reconstituted centralspindlin complex, comparing wt and mutant complexes.
