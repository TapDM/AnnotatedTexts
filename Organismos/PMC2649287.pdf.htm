This lack of overlap is robust. High <br /> &#8220;within pathway&#8221; content is not an inherent property of CWI-related <br /> networks. Rather, we conclude that null-null and hypomorphic-null <br /> networks behave very differently to each other, even for components <br /> of the CWI pathway. <br />     Our data are in apparent conflict with the results of recent work <br /> exploiting titration-expression alleles of essential genes in which there <br /> was no evidence for enrichment of &#8220;within pathway&#8221; characteristics <br /> in titration-null and titration-titration interactions.13 It is possible <br /> that the PKC1 network is unusual. Alternatively, it may be that <br /> titration expression alleles are unusual, and not truly hypomorphic. <br /> Indeed, these alleles are unusually profligate in eliciting synthetic                  Figure 2.
