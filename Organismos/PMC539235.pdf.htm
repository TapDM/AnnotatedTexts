DnaC809 and dnaC809,820 are suppressors of priA2::kan mutant phenotypes. The <br />                  former requires PriC and Rep while the latter is independent of them. RnhA339::cat mutations allow <br />                  DnaA-independent initiation of DNA replication. <br />                  Results: It is shown herein that a priC303::kan mutation is synthetically lethal with either a dnaA46 <br />                  or dnaA508 temperature sensitive mutation at the permissive temperature of 30&#176;C. The priC-dnaA <br />                  lethality is specific for the dnaA allele. The priC303::kan mutant was viable when placed in <br />                  combination with either dnaA5, dnaA167, dnaA204 or dnaA602. The priC-dnaA508 and priC-dnaA46 <br />                  lethality could be suppressed by rnhA339::cat. The priC-dnaA508 lethality could be suppressed by a <br />                  dnaC809,820 mutation, but not dnaC809.

Thus the inferences         restart may occur. <br /> from the two types of suppressors seem to contradict one <br /> another.                                                            There are many examples where several phenotypes had <br />                                                                     been tested systematically for several dnaA alleles (Table 1 <br /> What function(s) in dnaAts strains are missing for initia-          and [31-33]).

The model proposed to explain this phenomenon <br /> on the genetics and biochemistry of DnaA, the DnaA pro-             suggests that DnaA is required to activate transcription at <br /> tein can be divided into four domains with four proposed            the &#955; PR promoter and that the dnaA46, dnaA204 and <br /> functions: Domain I) DnaB recruitment, Domain II)                   dnaA508 mutations decrease this ability[27].

The two mutants that show a requirement for priC <br /> have mutations in Domains I (DnaB recruitment) and III              The results presented in this paper do not allow one to <br /> (ATP hydrolysis). However, several of the mutations not             definitively know whether the synthetic lethality studied <br /> requiring priC also affect Domain III. An interesting aspect        here is due to a failure in initiation of replication at oriC <br /> to dnaA genetics is that many temperature sensitive                 or is it due to a failure in replication restart based on the <br /> mutants have two mutations (Table 1 and [2]). The                   study of the suppressors. Since dnaA mutations can affect <br /> dnaA5, dnaA46 and dnaA602 all have mutations in                     more than just initiation of DNA replication, it is <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> tempting to speculate that some other dnaA function:                           <br /> transcription of a particular gene or set of genes or the            <br /> shape of nucleoid in the priC mutant may contribute or be                     <br /> the cause of the synthetic lethality. Understanding the                  <br /> molecular mechanism underlying the dnaAts-priC syn-               <br /> thetic lethality may require appreciation of these other             <br /> aspects of dnaA biology.                                   <br /> Conclusions                                                         <br /> A hitherto unknown function for either DnaA in replica-               <br /> tion restart or PriC in initiation of DNA replication that                  <br /> occurs in certain dnaA temperature sensitive strains at the                     <br /> permissive temperature of 30&#176;C has been documented.                    <br /> Models considering roles for PriC during initiation of                           <br /> DNA replication and roles for DnaA in replication restart                <br /> were tested and found not to decisively explain the data.                   <br /> Other roles of dnaA in transcription and nucleoid struc-                <br /> ture are additionally considered.                                 <br /> Methods                                                               <br /> Bacterial strains                                              <br /> All bacterial strains used in this work are derivatives of E.          <br /> coli K-12 and are described in Table 4.
