ATF3 has been reported to be <br />   expressed in ATL cells, but its biological significance is not known. <br />   Results: Immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that ATF3 interacts with HBZ. Expression of ATF3 was upregulated <br />   in ATL cell lines and fresh ATL cases. Reporter assay revealed that ATF3 could interfere with the HTLV-1 Tax&#8217;s <br />   transactivation of the 5&#8217; proviral long terminal repeat (LTR), doing so by affecting the ATF/CRE site, as well as HBZ. <br />   Suppressing ATF3 expression inhibited proliferation and strongly reduced the viability of ATL cells. As mechanisms <br />   of growth-promoting activity of ATF3, comparative expression profiling of ATF3 knockdown cells identified <br />   candidate genes that are critical for the cell cycle and cell death, including cell division cycle 2 (CDC2) and cyclin <br />   E2.

Both HBZ and ATF3 suppress Tax expression, which enables infected cells to <br />   escape the host immune system. <br />  <br />  <br /> Background                                                                              whereas that of usHBZ does not [8,12].
