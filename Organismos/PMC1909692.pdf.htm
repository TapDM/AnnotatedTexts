One such modification, histone methylation was considered <br />                                 irreversible until the recent discovery of histone demethylases. Lsd1 was the first demethylase to be <br />                                 identified [5]. Lsd1 is highly conserved from yeast to humans but its function has primarily been <br />                                 studied using biochemical approaches. The mammalian ortholog has been shown to demethylate <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                 mono and dimethyl K4 and K9 residues of histone H3 [5,6]. Here we describe the effects of Lsd1 <br />                                 mutation in Drosophila. The inactivation of dLsd1 strongly affects the global level of mono and <br />                                 dimethyl-H3-K4 methylation and results in elevated expression of a subset of genes. dLsd1 is not an <br />                                 essential gene, but animal viability is strongly reduced in mutant animals in a gender specific manner. <br />                                 Interestingly, dLsd1 mutants are sterile and possess defects in ovary development, indicating that <br />                                 dLsd1 has tissue specific functions. Mutant alleles of dLsd1 suppress positional effect variegation, <br />                                 suggesting a disruption of the balance between euchromatin and heterochromatin. Taken together, <br />                                 these results show that dLsd1-mediated H3-K4 demethylation has a significant and specific role <br />                                 during Drosophila development. <br />  <br />  <br />                            Results and Discussion <br />                                               Originally Lsd1 was found as a component of co-repressor complexes [7&#8211;11]. Lsd1 <br />                                               demethylase activity was only discovered recently [5] and was found to be modulated by its <br />                                               associated proteins, such as CoREST [12,13]. Lsd1 depletion in mammalian cells correlates <br />                                               with increased gene expression and elevated levels of H3-K4 methylation at target promoters <br />                                               [5]. However Lsd1 can also act as a co-activator and demethylates H3-K9, a repressive mark <br />                                               [6]. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                               Lsd1 is evolutionary conserved [5] but little is known about its biological function.

The SWIRM domain is thought to function in protein- <br />                                                protein interactions, DNA protein interaction and enzyme catalysis [16&#8211;19]. Inactivation of <br />                                                this domain greatly reduces the stability and demethylase activity of Lsd1 [16,17]. Western <br />                                                blot analysis showed that dLsd1 is expressed at high levels in wild-type (wt) flies but no dLsd1 <br />                                                protein was detected in dLsd1&#916;N homozygous flies (Fig. S2D). Hence dLsd1&#916;N is, most likely, <br />                                                a null allele. <br />  <br />                                                This collection of mutant alleles provided us with the opportunity to study the biological <br />                                                function of dLsd1 in an animal model system. <br />  <br />                                                First, we assessed the effects of dLsd1 mutation on viability. Crosses of dLsd1&#916;N heterozygous <br />                                                animals gave only one-third of the expected number of homozygous dLsd1&#916;N progeny (Table <br />                                                S1). Interestingly, this reduction in viability is more dramatic in the male progeny <br />                                                (approximately 90% of the viable dLsd1&#916;N homozygotes were females) (Table S2). <br />  <br />                                                dLsd1&#916;N mutants are sterile. In these animals, ovary development is severely impaired (Fig. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                1C,D). The Drosophila ovary consists of approximately 16 ovarioles, chains of developing <br />                                                egg-chambers with a germarium at the anterior tip. The germarium contains germline stem <br />                                                cells (GSC) and somatic stem cells (SSC) which give rise respectively to the germline cysts <br />                                                and to follicle cells (Fig. 1C,E,G,I,M) [20]. Interestingly, DNA staining shows that dLsd&#916;N <br />                                                mutant ovaries lack proper ovariole structures (Fig. 1D,F) and the formation of egg chambers <br />                                                is abnormal at very early stages. Both the germline and follicle cells appear abnormal (Fig. 1H, <br />                                                L, N) and, strikingly, the 16 cells cysts fail to be properly encapsulated by follicle cells (Fig. <br />                                                1H). In males, the testes are morphologically intact, but DNA staining suggests defects during <br />                                                spermatogenesis (data not shown). Interestingly, dLsd1&#916;N homozygotes also have a held-out <br />                                                wing phenotype (Fig. 1B) that renders them unable to fly. <br />  <br />                                                To confirm that these defects are due specifically to dLsd1 loss and are not the result of <br />                                                secondary mutations, we performed complementation tests with a deficiency (Df(3L) <br />                                                ED4858) that uncovers the dLsd1 gene (Table 3). Trans-heterozygotes carrying dLsd1&#916;N and <br />                                                Df(3L)ED4858 recapitulated the phenotypes observed in dLsd1&#916;N homozygous flies (Table <br />                                                S3). <br />  <br />                                                We conclude that dLsd1 mutation reduces viability in a gender-dependent manner, causes <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                abnormal ovary development, and results in animal sterility. Collectively, these results point <br />                                                to important roles for dLsd1 in the late stages of development. dLsd1 levels are highest in the <br />                                                embryonic stages (Fig. S2E,F), suggesting that dLsd1 might also have functions during early <br />                                                stages of development that may be masked in the homozygous dLsd1 mutants by maternally <br />                                                supplied products. <br />  <br />                                                Biochemical studies with human Lsd1 have led to reports that Lsd1 can act both as a co- <br />                                                repressor of transcription by demethylating H3-K4 [5], and as a co-activator by demethylating <br />                                                H3-K9 [6]. To ask which of these potential activities is predominant in Drosophila, we <br />                                                examined the levels of histone modification in dLsd1 mutant flies. The global level of mono <br />                                                and dimethyl-H3-K4 was considerably higher in dLsd1 mutants than in wild-type flies (Fig. <br />                                                2A,B); this effect was particularly striking in adult males (Fig. 2B). In contrast, we found no <br />                                                increase in the global levels of methyl-H3-K9, indeed the level of dimethyl and trimethyl-H3- <br />                                                K9 decreased slightly in dLsd1 mutants (Fig. 2A,B).

Interestingly, ovaries contain a higher level of dLsd1 and a <br />                                                lower level of monomethyl-H3-K4 than the rest of the adult female (Fig. 2C), potentially <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                explaining why dLsd1 mutation selectively perturbs ovary development. <br />  <br />                                                As a further test, we generated UAST-dLsd1 transgenic flies and found that increased levels of <br />                                                dLsd1 reduced di and monomethyl-H3-K4 (Fig. 2D), confirming that dLsd1 is a critical <br />                                                determinant of the global level of H3-K4 methylation. Surprisingly, these animals lacked any <br />                                                clear developmental defects. <br />  <br />                                                H3-K4 methyl residues are highly enriched in euchromatin. To test whether the elevated levels <br />                                                of mono and dimethyl-H3-K4 in dLsd1 mutants alter the balance between euchromatin and <br />                                                heterochromatin, we used three variegating systems (T(2;3)Stubblevariegated (Sbv), In(1) <br />                                                y3Pyellow and In(1)whitem4h) and asked whether dLsd1 alleles modify positional effect <br />                                                variegation (PEV). PEV is the mosaic pattern of gene silencing observed when genes that are <br />                                                normally located in euchromatin regions are placed into a heterochromatic environment [21]. <br />                                                Suppressors of PEV include mutants of heterochromatin-associated proteins, such as HP1 and <br />                                                the histone H3-K9 methyltransferase Su(var)3&#8211;9 [22]. <br />  <br />                                                T(2;3)Sbv translocation juxtaposes the Sb mutation and the centric heterochromatin of the <br />                                                second chromosome, resulting in mosaic flies with both Sb and normal bristles [23,24]. <br />                                                Activation of dominant Sb results in stubble bristles. When T(2;3)Sbv was crossed to <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                dLsd1&#916;N, we observed a significant increase in the frequency of Sb bristles (Fig. 3A). Similar <br />                                                results were found using the yellow locus [25,26]. Analysis of bristles in the wing of In(1) <br />                                                y3P/+; +; dLsd1&#916;N/+ flies (Fig. 5B) showed that a single allele of dLsd1&#916;N or dLsd12 <br />                                                suppressed yellow variegation, giving a 25% reduction of yellow bristles (Fig. 3C). Suppression <br />                                                of variegation was also observed using wm4h (Fig. S3). These results indicate that dLsd1 alleles <br />                                                are potent suppressors of PEV and suggest that the absence of dLsd1 alters chromatin structure. <br />  <br />                                                Mono and dimethyl forms of H3-K4 are linked to transcriptional activation; the increased level <br />                                                of these modifications in dLsd1&#916;N mutants suggests that dLsd1 normally represses <br />                                                transcription. Previous studies with human cells have shown that Lsd1 regulates the expression <br />                                                of neuron-specific genes [12]. To ask whether this function is conserved, we depleted dLsd1 <br />                                                from SL2 cells using RNAi and examined the expression of neuron-specific genes, such as <br />                                                Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor <span id='am-1' about='obo:NCBITaxon_3554' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_78536 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_3398 obo:NCBITaxon_1437183 obo:NCBITaxon_33090 obo:NCBITaxon_3563 obo:NCBITaxon_91827 obo:NCBITaxon_71240 obo:NCBITaxon_131221 obo:NCBITaxon_58024 obo:NCBITaxon_1437201 obo:NCBITaxon_58023 obo:NCBITaxon_3524 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_35493 obo:NCBITaxon_3193'><span id='am-2' property="rdfs:label" content="Beta" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-3' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-4' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Beta L. 1753" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-5' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-6'  ></span>beta</span> (nAcr&#946;) and Na channel (Nach). dLsd1 depletion <br />                                                increased the level of monomethyl-H3-K4 and increased the expression of both nAcr&#946; and <br />                                                Nach (Fig. 4A), indicating that Lsd1&#8217;s role in the repression of neuron-specific genes is <br />                                                conserved between Drosophila and humans. <br />  <br />                                                The homeobox (Hox) gene locus is subject to extensive H3-K4 methylation by Trithorax group <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                proteins [27]. We therefore asked whether the expression level of the Hox genes Ultrabithorax <br />                                                (Ubx) and abdominal-A (abdA), is affected by dLsd1 depletion. Ubx and abdA mRNA levels <br />                                                increased two-fold in SL2 cells treated with dLsd1 double stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Fig. 4A). <br />                                                These changes were specific and were not seen with other control genes (dDP and Hid). To <br />                                                verify the relevance of these observations in vivo we compared the expression of these genes <br />                                                in wild-type and dLsd1&#916;N mutant flies. A significant upregulation of each of these targets was <br />                                                found in dLsd1&#916;N mutant flies (Fig. 4B and data not shown), confirming the importance of <br />                                                dLsd1-mediated repression in vivo. Intriguingly we observe that this upregulation is age <br />                                                dependent: the difference in gene expression is minimal in larval stages, consistent with this <br />                                                the Hox gene expression pattern in imaginal discs from dLsd1&#916;N mutant larvae and in embryos <br />                                                is largely unaltered (Fig. S4). However the level of nAcr&#946;, Ubx and Abd-B gradually and <br />                                                significantly increases with age after eclosion (Fig. 4B), suggesting that dLsd1 function is <br />                                                especially important for the regulation of gene expression in adult tissues. <br />  <br />  <br />                                                       Curr Biol.

The results help to place the previously described biochemical activities <br />                                                of Lsd1 into a biological context and show that dLsd1 is a key determinant of the global levels <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                of mono and dimethyl-H3-K4 in vivo. dLsd1 mutation impacts heterochromatin homeostasis <br />                                                and leads to ectopic expression of a subset of genes in flies. Curiously we observe that the <br />                                                consequences of the global upregulation of H3-K4 methylation on animal development are <br />                                                restricted to a few specific organs. One of the clearest defects is in the ovary where dLsd1&#916;N <br />                                                mutant egg chambers are abnormal early in development and follicle cells fail to encapsulate <br />                                                the cyst. This defect is consistent with the observation that dLsd1 is highly expressed in the <br />                                                ovary, and indicates that dLsd1 mediated demethylation of H3-K4 plays a crucial role in this <br />                                                organ. We suggest that, in dLsd1&#916;N mutants, the elevated expression level of dLsd1 target <br />                                                genes causes tissue specific defects. We note that both Hox genes and neuron-specific genes <br />                                                are among the target upregulated in dLsd1&#916;N mutants. The upregulation occurs late in <br />                                                development and this may explain the lack of homeotic phenotypes or other early <br />                                                developmental defects in dLsd1&#916;N mutants. The stronger changes in histone modification seen <br />                                                in dLsd1&#916;N mutant males compared to females and the sex dependent lethality caused by <br />                                                dLsd1 mutation raise the possibility that dLsd1 may have a sex-specific distribution on <br />                                                chromatin alternatively its mutation may alter the chromatin distribution of the male specific <br />                                                lethal complex. <br />  <br />                                                Whereas mammalian Lsd1 has been shown to be able to demethylate H3-K9 [6], we saw no <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                increase in the global level of dimethylated H3-K9. This indicates that this activity is either <br />                                                not conserved in Drosophila, or that is redundant with other demethylases, or that is restricted <br />                                                to specific loci and/or specific tissues. <br />  <br />                                                This study opens the road to further studies aimed at delineating the specific functions of dLsd1 <br />                                                in the control of gene expression. Genome-wide studies will be necessary to identify all the <br />                                                dLsd1 regulated genes and to identify the target genes responsible for each of the developmental <br />                                                defects. <br />  <br />                                                One important implication of the tissue specific defects seen in the dLsd1&#916;N mutant animals <br />                                                is the possibility that dLsd1 may be manipulated in vivo to modulate specific biological <br />                                                processes.
