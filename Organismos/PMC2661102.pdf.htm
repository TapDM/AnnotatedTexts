At 8 and 16 h, the major response is an upregulation of                         ionic strength. However, hsps are underrepresented in the <br /> genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism.

The impression is thus gained that Dro- <br /> zinc finger transcription factor sugarbabe (sug), a transcription                     sophila, with its relatively sophisticated osmoregulatory <br /> factor that has previously been implicated in starvation and                          system, can defend its internal environment effectively <br /> sugar stress responses (45).

Effect of modulation of tubule CG2196 <br /> expression on whole fly survival after salt chal- <br /> lenge. Flies were allowed to lay eggs on 4% NaCl <br /> diet, then the numbers of progeny reaching adult- <br /> hood were counted and compared with survival of <br /> RNAi, eYFP, or c42 parental lines.
