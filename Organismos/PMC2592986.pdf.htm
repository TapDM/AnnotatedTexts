Based on the sequence alignment and functional similarity,                          <br /> Barkor is a good candidate to be the mammalian functional                                      <br /> ortholog of Atg14, the autophagy-specific regulatory factor for                        <br /> Atg6/Beclin 1 in yeast (10, 11). Both Barkor and Atg14 possess a                                 <br /> zinc finger motif at the N terminus and a central CCD. Barkor also                          <br /> shares 18% sequence identity and 32% sequence similarity with                                    <br /> yeast Atg14 (Fig. S3). Critically, both Barkor and Atg14 direct                                <br /> Beclin 1/Atg6 to the autophagosome.                                                              <br />    It is interesting to note that Barkor competes with UVRAG for                                 <br /> its binding to Beclin 1, similar to the interplay between Atg14 and                            <br />  <br /> </body></html>
