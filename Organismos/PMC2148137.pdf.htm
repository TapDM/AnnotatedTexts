Four potential Cdc31p interacting clones were                                   nases (Hanks et al., 1988; Lindberg et al., 1992). The puta- <br /> isolated.

No information about the <br /> function of the gene had been published; however its se- <br /> quence indicates that it is an asparagine-rich kinase. We <br /> therefore named the gene KIC1 to indicate its role as a ki- <br /> nase that interacts with Cdc31p. KIC1 corresponds to the <br /> open reading frame YHR102W identified by the yeast Ge- <br /> nome Sequencing Project. <br />    Liquid b-galactosidase assays were performed to con- <br /> firm the interaction between Cdc31p and Kic1p. As re- <br /> ported in Table III, neither the Gal4&#8211;Cdc31p fusion nor <br /> the Gal4&#8211;Kic1p fusion plasmids caused any b-galactosi- <br /> dase expression on their own. Expressed in a strain to- <br /> gether, they produced 141 units of b-galactosidase activity, <br /> .1,000 times above the background. Because of the the <br /> homology between Cdc31p and calmodulin, we also tested <br /> whether the Kic1p kinase interacted with calmodulin by <br /> the two-hybrid test. A yeast Gal4&#8211;calmodulin fusion did <br /> not confer any b-galactosidase activity when coexpressed <br /> with Gal4&#8211;Kic1p (see Table III), indicating that the Kic1p <br /> interaction was specific to Cdc31p. <br />  <br /> Kic1p Is an Essential PAK Kinase <br /> The full-length KIC1 gene was isolated from a genomic <br /> yeast library by hybridization with a DNA probe from the <br /> two-hybrid clone. An URA3-marked deletion of the gene <br /> was constructed in a diploid by a one-step gene replace- <br /> ment (Rothstein, 1991). Tetrad analysis of the heterozy- <br /> gous diploid (MY3605) demonstrated that KIC1 is essen- <br /> tial for viability.

The cdc31-2 and CDC31-16 mutants also exhib- <br /> ited weak lysis phenotypes, which were suppressed by 1 M <br /> sorbitol (Table IV, lines 14&#8211;16, 20&#8211;22). In Fig. 7, asterisks <br /> mark examples of lysed cells, and double asterisks mark <br /> cell debris. In addition to the lysis defect, both the cdc31-1 <br /> and cdc31-2 mutants arrested with an unusual bud mor- <br /> phology; #50% of the arrested cells had long narrow buds <br /> (Fig. 7, double arrows; and Table IV, lines 11&#8211;16). This <br /> phenotype was also partially suppressed by the presence <br /> of 1 M sorbitol. <br />    Neither the long bud morphology nor lysis has been re- <br /> ported for mutants with defects in spindle assembly that <br /> cause a G2/M arrest. We therefore re-examined the large <br /> bud arrest phenotype of several yeast b-tubulin mutants <br /> (Huffaker et al., 1988) and found no evidence of either <br /> elongated buds or cell lysis (data not shown). Further- <br /> more, the long bud phenotype did not lead to lysis in <br /> cdc31-1 (Table IV, lines 11&#8211;13; Fig. 7), nor did lysis of <br /> cdc31-5 and CDC31-16 require the presence of long buds <br /> (Table IV, lines 17-22; Fig. 7).
