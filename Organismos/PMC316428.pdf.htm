Thus, Ctf7p is essential for <br /> cohesion. Cohesion is established during S phase and then maintained until mitosis. However, Ctf7p activity <br /> is required only during S phase, suggesting that Ctf7p functions in the establishment of cohesion. In addition, <br /> ctf7 genetically interacts with DNA metabolism mutations pol30 (PCNA) and ctf18 (an RF-C like protein) and <br /> ctf7 temperature sensitivity and chromosome loss are rescued by high levels of POL30. These findings provide <br /> the first evidence that links the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion to the DNA replication machinery <br /> and suggest that the assembly of cohesion (and possibly condensation) complexes are coupled to <br /> PCNA-dependent DNA replication. The analysis of Ctf7p also reveals an important connection between sister <br /> chromatid cohesion, spindle integrity and the spindle assemby checkpoint. <br /> [Key Words: CTF7; chromosome loss; BUB3; MAD2; POL30; chromatid cohesion; condensation] <br /> Received October 9, 1998; revised version accepted November 30, 1998. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> Cohesion between replicated sister chromatids is funda-                  cohesion complexes are inactivated and the sister chro- <br /> mental to cell viability.

To determine whether ctf7 cells re- <br /> quired either of these checkpoint mechanisms to delay <br /> in mitosis, we constructed strains containing ctf7 in <br /> combination with either mutations in the DNA damage <br /> checkpoint pathway (rad9&#9004; and mec1-1) (Weinert and <br /> Hartwell 1988, 1990; Weinert et al. 1994) or mutations in <br /> the kinetochore/spindle assembly checkpoint pathway <br /> (mad2-1 and bub3&#9004;) (Hoyt et al. 1991; Li and Murray <br /> 1991).

In contrast, ctf7 cells contained high HA&#8211;Pds1p <br /> levels, indicating that ctf7 cells were delayed prior to <br /> anaphase onset. To confirm that ctf7 cells were delayed <br /> in metaphase, HA&#8211;Pds1p was visualized by immunoflu- <br /> orescence in wild-type and ctf7 cells treated as above. As <br /> expected, wild-type cells with separating DNA masses <br /> did not contain HA&#8211;Pds1p (Cohen-Fix et al. 1996). In <br /> contrast to wild-type cells, a significant population of <br /> ctf7 cells with separating DNA masses contained high <br /> levels of HA&#8211;Pds1p (Fig. 4B). Thus, these ctf7 cells were <br /> delayed prior to anaphase onset. It was not surprising <br /> that some ctf7 cells with separating DNA masses did not <br /> contain detectable HA&#8211;Pds1p levels, because ctf7 cells <br /> are only delayed in the cell cycle and eventually exit <br /> mitosis.

Wild-type cells were not adversely affected by <br /> this procedure and maintained high viability. As ex- <br /> pected, mcd1-1 cells exhibited a dramatic decrease in <br /> viability within the first hour of incubation at 37&#176;C. In <br /> contrast, ctf7-203 cells retained high viability even after <br /> 3 hr incubation at 37&#176;C. Thus, Ctf7p is not required dur- <br /> ing mitosis when sister chromatid cohesion is main- <br /> tained. However, Ctf7p is required during S phase when <br /> cohesion is established. ctf7-203 and mcd1-1 mutant <br /> cells both exhibited decreased viability when synchro- <br /> nized cells were allowed to proceed from G1 in to mitosis <br /> at 37&#176;C. The combination of these results suggest that <br /> Ctf7p plays a role in cohesion distinct from Mcd1p. <br />    The high viability of ctf7-203 cells allowed to proceed <br /> into mitosis before shifting them to the restrictive tem- <br /> perature implied that Ctf7p was not required for the <br /> maintenance of cohesion.
