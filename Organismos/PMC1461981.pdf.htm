Two mutant eIF5A proteins contain mutations in a proline residue at the junction between the two <br />              eIF5A domains and the third, strongest allele encodes a protein with a single mutation in each domain, <br />              both of which are required for the growth defect. The stronger tif51A alleles cause defects in degradation <br />              of short-lived mRNAs, supporting a role for this protein in mRNA decay. A multicopy suppressor screen <br />              revealed six genes, the overexpression of which allows growth of a tif51A-1 strain at high temperature; <br />              these genes include PAB1, PKC1, and PKC1 regulators WSC1, WSC2, and WSC3. Further results suggest <br />              that eIF5A may also be involved in ribosomal synthesis and the WSC/PKC1 signaling pathway for cell wall <br />              integrity or related processes. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> R   EGULATION of the fate of cytoplasmic mRNA in- <br />       volves a delicate balance between its recruitment <br /> to ribosomes for translation and its degradation by <br />                                                                              eIF5A being an initiation factor for general protein syn- <br />                                                                              thesis. <br />                                                                                 Alternatively, it was suggested that eIF5A could be <br /> nucleolytic enzymes.

The diploids that re- <br /> sulted from these crosses were sporulated and subjected <br /> to tetrad analysis. If the mutations present in the npl2 <br /> strains were linked to TIF51A, the temperature-sensitive <br /> phenotype of the mutants would never cosegregate with <br /> the URA3 gene. For npl2-1, 25 complete asci were ana- <br /> lyzed and no temperature-sensitive Ura&#11001; spore was ob- <br /> served. The same result was obtained with npl2-2 and <br /> npl2-3, after analyzing 15 and 17 complete asci, respec- <br /> tively. These results demonstrate that npl2-1, npl2-2, and <br /> npl2-3 are linked to TIF51A. Therefore, the npl2 mutants <br /> presented here contain temperature-sensitive alleles of <br /> the gene encoding eIF5A and are henceforth referred <br /> to as tif51A-1, tif51A-2, and tif51A-3. <br />    These three TIF51A temperature-sensitive alleles were <br /> cloned by PCR into pRS315 (CEN/LEU2) using genomic <br /> DNA obtained from the tif51A strains. To test whether <br /> the cloned mutant alleles of TIF51A were functional, <br /> we generated a strain in which TIF51A was disrupted. <br /> Sporulation of a heterozygous TIF51A/tif51A&#9004;::HIS3 <br /> diploid revealed that TIF51A is an essential gene since <br /> only two viable his&#11002; spores were obtained in 24 tetrads <br /> analyzed. This result agreed with Wohl et al. (1993) <br /> and with the isolation of temperature-sensitive alleles <br /> of TIF51A. In contrast, another report showed that cells <br /> lacking TIF51A grow slowly and become inviable only <br /> when TIF51B is also disrupted (Schnier et al. 1991). <br /> This discrepancy may be due to strain background dif- <br /> ferences. <br />    The three TIF51A alleles demonstrate varying degrees <br /> of temperature sensitivity upon growth at 37&#11034; on rich <br /> media, YEPD (Figure 1A).

Although tif51A mutant strains showed             and growth was monitored for 8 hr by spectrophotometry <br /> slightly slower growth than the wild-type strain at 25&#11034;        (OD600 nm).

PKC1 overexpression may suppress tif51A-1 by                         <br /> increasing phosphorylation of the mutant protein. Al-              <br /> ternatively, PKC1 could phosphorylate a protein that                   <br /> interacts with eIF5A and that is important for its func-                    <br /> tion.

This protein has                <br /> been shown to be phosphorylated specifically by PKC                           <br /> in vitro (Kang and Chung 1999) and contains three                          <br /> potential target S/T residues with basic residues on both                <br /> sides.

The exact mechanism of                      <br /> PKC suppression will be the focus of future investiga-                   <br /> tion.                                                                 <br />    The isolation of PAB1, PKC1, and the WSC genes as                 <br /> high-copy suppressors of tif51A-1 points to different                     <br /> roles for eIF5A in RNA metabolism from mRNA decay to                         <br /> ribosome synthesis. The allele specificity of suppression                   <br /> suggests that eIF5A may have more than one important                   <br /> role in the cell, leading to functional differences be-                     <br /> tween the alleles.
