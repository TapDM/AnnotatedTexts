We studied the role of Rad53 phosphorylation through <br />           mutation of consensus phosphorylation sites for upstream kinases Mec1 and Tel1. Alanine substitution of the <br />           Rad53 amino-terminal TQ cluster region reduced viability and impaired checkpoint functions. These substi- <br />           tution mutations spared the basal interaction with Asf1 and the DNA damage-induced interactions with Rad9. <br />           However, they caused a decrease in DNA damage-induced Rad53 kinase activity and an impaired interaction <br />           with the protein kinase Dun1. The Dun1 FHA (Forkhead-associated) domain recognized the amino-terminal TQ <br />           cluster of Rad53 after DNA damage or replication blockade. Thus, the phosphorylation of Rad53 by upstream <br />           kinases is important not only for Rad53 activation but also for creation of an interface between Rad53 and Dun1. <br />  <br />  <br />   Failure in maintenance of genomic integrity allows the ac-                  minal BRCT domains and are phosphorylated with checkpoint <br /> cumulation of mutations that may promote carcinogenesis.                      activation include 53BP1 (6, 12, 64), MDC1 (21, 33, 46, 55, 56, <br /> Cells employ many mechanisms to ensure complete and accu-                     68), and BRCA1 (70). <br /> rate transmission of genomic DNA to daughter cells.
