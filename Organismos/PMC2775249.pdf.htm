Multiple roles of the cytoskeleton during Drosophila myogenesis. (A) Muscle assembly requires multiple steps, some of which occur simulta- <br /> neously. Shown is a myoblast fusing to a multinucleated myotube as it elongates and searches for the proper attachment sites. The actin cytoskeleton <br /> (shown in red) is required for fusion at the central region of the myotube as well as at the myotube ends for target recognition during muscle attach- <br /> ment site selection. A polarized microtubule array (green) is found along the linear axis of the myotube with minus ends anchored near the nuclei, <br /> at the interior of the muscle fiber (black) and the plus ends directed outwards. (B) Myoblast-Myotube Fusion. Recent studies have shown that a dense <br /> actin focus (red oval) is critical for myoblast fusion to a multinucleated myotube. The formation of the actin focus is driven by actin regulators such as <br /> WASp, WIP and Arp2/3. (C) Myotube Elongation. Myotube elongation requires a uniform microtubule array based at the nuclear periphery. Through <br /> interaction with Pavarotti, RacGAP localizes to the nuclear periphery where it colocalizes with the microtubule nucleator protein g-tubulin to establish <br /> a polarized microtubule array. It is not clear whether RacGAP and g-tubulin directly interact in the myotube. (D) Target Recognition. Many molecules <br /> accumulate at myotube ends where they are required for the selection of appropriate attachment sites. These molecules include the well-known axon <br /> guidance molecules Slit and Roundabout. Kon-tiki and Echinoid are also involved in myotube target recognition, and both molecules are able to bind <br /> Grip, a downstream scaffolding protein. These molecules are required for target recognition within the same subset of myotubes, but it is unclear how <br /> they are coordinated. The Drosophila homologue of GIT was also recently implicated in target recognition. To date, common downstream signals that <br /> direct cytoskeletal rearrangements required for target recognition remain largely unknown. MSP-300 may be one molecule that mediates actin dynamics <br /> at the plasma membrane. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> www.landesbioscience.com                                      Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology                                                     453 <br />                                               Cytoskeletal remodeling durring myotube assembly and guidance <br />  <br />  <br /> cell autonomously in specific muscle subsets to sense guidance               regulation of cell motility, morphogenesis and cell-cell contacts.39-41 <br /> cues, much in the same way as axons do.
