Consistently, using radioactive labeled leucine, <br />              we show that cells treated with rapamycin or disrupted for tor1&#11001; are defective in leucine uptake when the <br />              nitrogen source is ammonia but not proline. Recently, it has been reported that tsc1&#11001; and tsc2&#11001;, the S. <br />              pombe homologs for the mammalian TSC1 and TSC2, are also defective in leucine uptake. TSC1 and TSC2 <br />              may antagonize TOR signaling in mammalian cells and Drosophila. We show that reduction of leucine <br />              uptake in tor1 mutants is correlated with decreased expression of three putative amino acid permeases <br />              that are also downregulated in tsc1 or tsc2. These findings suggest a possible mechanism for regulation <br />              of leucine uptake by tor1p and indicate that tor1p, as well as tsc1p and tsc2p, positively regulates leucine <br />              uptake in S. pombe. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> T    HE TOR (target of r apamycin) kinases form an evolu- <br />      tionary conserved <span id='am-52' about='obo:NCBITaxon_family' typeof='owl:Thing NCBITaxon:_taxonomic_rank'><span id='am-53' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-54' property="rdfs:label" content="family" datatype="xsd:string"></span>family</span> of large proteins with a ki- <br /> nase domain that resembles phosphatidylinositide (PI) <br />                                                                              variety of human tumors (Bjornsti and Houghton <br />                                                                              2004; Fingar and Blenis 2004).

Two leucine-uptake systems <br /> were identified in S. pombe, a high- and a low-affinity <br /> system (Sychrova et al. 1989). We first measured leu- <br /> cine uptake in media that contains ammonia as the <br /> nitrogen source (EMM) in the presence of 0.01 mm <br /> leucine, conditions under which only the high-affinity <br /> system is expected to transport leucine at a significant <br /> capacity (Karagiannis et al. 1999; Matsumoto et al. <br /> 2002). As shown in Figure 5A, the uptake of rapamycin- <br /> treated cells was &#11601;40% of the untreated wild-type cells. <br /> Similarly, the rate of uptake by &#9004;tor1 cells was &#11601;40% of <br /> the wild-type cells. We also measured leucine uptake in <br /> EMM media in the presence of 2 mm leucine, conditions <br /> under which both systems are expected to import leu- <br /> cine, although the majority of leucine uptake can be <br /> attributed to the function of the low-affinity system <br /> (Karagiannis et al. 1999; Matsumoto et al. 2002). In <br /> the presence of 2 mm leucine, leucine uptake by rapa- <br /> mycin-treated cells is reduced to &#11601;50% of the untreated <br /> wild-type strain, while leucine uptake by &#9004;tor1 cells is <br /> even further reduced to &#11601;30% of the wild-type strain <br /> (Figure 5B). Importantly, uptake of radioactively la- <br /> beled leucine was not reduced when cells treated with <br /> rapamycin or deleted for tor1 were grown in medium <br /> containing proline instead of ammonia (Figure 5C), <br /> consistent with our observation that the growth of leucine <br /> auxotrophs is not inhibited on proline plates (Figure 3B). <br /> Taken together, we conclude that rapamycin-treated or <br /> &#9004;tor1 cells grown in ammonia-containing medium are de- <br /> fective in leucine uptake.
