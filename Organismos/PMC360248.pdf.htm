First, ymel-1 strains                  YMI I <br /> could not grow on medium containing a 25-,ug/ml concentra- <br /> tion of ethidium bromide (Fig. 1C), a drug that very effi- <br /> ciently induces rho- mutations (14). Second, the ymel-1 <br /> allele caused inviability in strains that also carried a null <br /> petl23 mutation, which is known to destabilize rho&apos; mtDNA           C ymel-AI::11l/A43 <br /> (16). The ymel mutant strain PTY62 was crossed with the                                                                     YMUIJ <br /> petl23::URA3 strain PTH78, and the resulting diploids were                       IYMliII         Ad                        Vec tor <br /> sporulated. Twenty tetrads were dissected on YPD medium <br /> and scored for growth, respiratory ability, and uracil pro- <br /> totrophy (to follow segregation of petl23::URA3). One- <br /> quarter of the spores did not yield viable haploids, although     ymclI-Al::1IRA.4 <br /> they germinated and formed microcolonies. In all cases the               lVectorl                                           I YMFI <br /> viable spores either were wild type or contained the ymel-1 <br /> orpetl23::URA3 mutation, but not both. <br />    The ymel-I mutation was not simply incompatible with <br /> unconditional respiratory defects.

A total block of                <br /> mitochondrial division would be expected to produce a lethal               <br /> phenotype (27, 28, 51).                                                    <br />    Whatever role Ymelp may play in mitochondrial function,         <br /> the polypeptide appears to be part of a multimeric complex.        <br />                                                                     <br /> We observed intragenic complementation between the ap-               <br /> parent missense allele ymel-1 and the uncharacterized               <br /> ymel-3 mutation, suggesting that the functional unit contains              <br /> more than one copy of Ymelp. In addition, an elevated gene         <br /> dosage of YME1 did not cause overaccumulation of the               <br /> protein, suggesting that the level of a complex containing       <br /> Ymelp is limited by the level of some other component and               <br /> that unassembled Ymelp may be degraded. Our previous                   <br /> observation that aymel yme2 double mutant had a synthetic          <br /> nonrespiratory phenotype (44) suggests the possibility that               <br /> the YME2 product could be part of such a complex.                           <br />    A novel consequence of ymel mutations is that they                       <br /> convert the petite-positive yeast S. cerevisiae into respiring          <br /> (at permissive temperatures) petite-negative strains by pre-             <br /> venting the growth of rho- cells. This property will be useful              <br /> for many genetic screens and selections in which the very             <br /> frequent rho- mutations represent background that can now                   <br /> be easily eliminated. The opi (pet9) mutation also kills rho-            <br /> cells. However, this mutation, which inactivates a major               <br /> mitochondrial ADP-ATP translocator, also prevents respira-                <br /> tory growth (20, 22). Interestingly, other recent evidence                  <br /> also indicates that the differences between petite-positive                 <br /> and petite-negative yeasts may not be very great. Nuclear                <br /> mutations have been selected in the petite-negative yeasts                  <br /> <span id='am-35' about='obo:NCBITaxon_4895' typeof='obo:NCBITaxon_33154 owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_451864 obo:NCBITaxon_451866 obo:NCBITaxon_147554 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_4890 obo:NCBITaxon_34346 obo:NCBITaxon_4751 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_4894 obo:NCBITaxon_2759'><span id='am-36' property="rdfs:label" content="Schizosaccharomyces" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-37'  ></span><span id='am-38' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-39' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Schizosaccharomyces</span> pombe (15) and <span id='am-6' about='obo:NCBITaxon_4910' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_4751 obo:NCBITaxon_4893 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_451864 obo:NCBITaxon_4892 obo:NCBITaxon_4891 obo:NCBITaxon_4890 obo:NCBITaxon_716545 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_147537'><span id='am-7'  ></span><span id='am-8' property="rdfs:label" content="Kluyveromyces" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-9' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-10' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Kluyveromyces</span> lactis                     <br /> (2) that allow them to tolerate the loss of mtDNA.                    <br />   <br /> </body></html>
