The human catalytic subunit PP2Ac&#9251; <br />              functionally replaces the endogenous yeast enzyme, Pph22p, indicating a conservation of function in vivo. <br />              Therefore, yeast cells were employed to explore the role of invariant PP2Ac residues. The PP2Ac&#9251; Y127N <br />              substitution abolished essential PP2Ac function in vivo and impaired catalysis severely in vitro, consistent <br />              with the prediction from structural studies that Tyr-127 mediates substrate binding and its side chain <br />              interacts with the key active site residues His-118 and Asp-88. The V159E substitution similarly impaired <br />              PP2Ac&#9251; catalysis profoundly and may cause global disruption of the active site. Two conditional mutations <br />              in the yeast Pph22p protein, F232S and P240H, were found to cause temperature-sensitive impairment <br />              of PP2Ac catalytic function in vitro. Thus, the mitotic and cell lysis defects conferred by these mutations <br />              result from a loss of PP2Ac enzyme activity. Substitution of the PP2Ac&#9251; C-terminal Tyr-307 residue by <br />              phenylalanine impaired protein function, whereas the Y307D and T304D substitutions abolished essential <br />              function in vivo. Nevertheless, Y307D did not reduce PP2Ac&#9251; catalytic activity significantly in vitro, consistent <br />              with an important role for the C terminus in mediating essential protein-protein interactions. Our results <br />              identify key residues important for PP2Ac function and characterize new reagents for the study of PP2A <br />              in vivo. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> P    ROTEIN phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is ubiquitous <br />      among eukaryotes and is implicated in multiple cel- <br /> lular processes including signal transduction, cell cycle <br />                                                                               served C-terminal Leu-309 residue undergoes reversible <br />                                                                               methylation catalyzed by a competing methyltransferase <br />                                                                               and methylesterase enzyme (Lee and Stock 1993; Favre <br /> regulation, and protein synthesis (Goldberg 1999).

PP2Ac binds a structural subunit                          subunit interactions (Ogris et al. 1997; Chung et al. <br /> PR65/A (Ruediger et al. 1992, 1994; Groves et al. 1999),                      1999). Additionally, PP2Ac can be phosphorylated on <br /> forming a core dimer that in turn binds a PR55/B,                             threonine in vitro, leading to a decrease in catalytic <br /> PR61/B&#11032;, or PR72/B&#8243; subunit (reviewed in Wera and                             activity (Guo and Damuni 1993), although the site of <br /> Hemmings 1995). In addition, PP2Ac binds other pro-                           modification is unknown. <br /> teins, notably the novel &#9251;4 subunit (Murata et al. 1997),                        PP2A is a member of the PPP family of protein Ser/ <br /> in alternative heterodimers. Moreover, recent evidence                        Thr phosphatases that includes protein phosphatase 1 <br /> indicates that PP2A forms stable complexes with protein                       (PP1) and PP2B (calcineurin). These protein phospha- <br /> kinase signaling molecules (Millward et al. 1999), indi-                      tases share many invariant amino acids, especially active <br /> cating that it plays a central, regulatory role in signal                     site residues believed to be involved in metal ion and/ <br /> transduction mediated by reversible protein phosphory-                        or substrate binding and catalysis (Barton et al. 1994). <br /> lation.                                                                       The crystal structure of PP1&#9253;1 suggests a model for the <br />   Additional regulation of PP2Ac activity is mediated by                      catalytic mechanism of the PPP family (Egloff et al. <br /> post-translational modification of the C terminus.
