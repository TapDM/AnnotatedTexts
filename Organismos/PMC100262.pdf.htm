Using a large subunit reporter (Rpl25p-eGFP), we have isolated several <br />          temperature-sensitive ribosomal export (rix) mutants. One of these corresponds to the ribosomal protein <br />          Rpl10p, which interacts directly with Nmd3p, a conserved and essential protein associated with 60S subunits. <br />          We find that thermosensitive nmd3 mutants are impaired in large subunit export. Strikingly, Nmd3p shuttles <br />          between the nucleus and cytoplasm and is exported by the nuclear export receptor Xpo1p. Moreover, we show <br />          that export of 60S subunits is Xpo1p dependent. We conclude that nuclear export of 60S subunits requires the <br />          nuclear export sequence-containing nonribosomal protein Nmd3p, which directly binds to the large subunit <br />          protein Rpl10p. <br />  <br />  <br />    Most steps in ribosome synthesis take place in the nucleolus,            tors (6). We have reported an in vivo assay for ribosomal <br /> a specialized subnuclear region. <span id='am-49' about='obo:NCBITaxon_169495' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_33340 obo:NCBITaxon_33213 obo:NCBITaxon_169440 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_7147 obo:NCBITaxon_43733 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_43738 obo:NCBITaxon_480117 obo:NCBITaxon_33317 obo:NCBITaxon_169449 obo:NCBITaxon_480118 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_6072 obo:NCBITaxon_6960 obo:NCBITaxon_43750 obo:NCBITaxon_33208 obo:NCBITaxon_85512 obo:NCBITaxon_197562 obo:NCBITaxon_197563 obo:NCBITaxon_7203 obo:NCBITaxon_6656 obo:NCBITaxon_7496 obo:NCBITaxon_1206794 obo:NCBITaxon_88770 obo:NCBITaxon_33392 obo:NCBITaxon_169455 obo:NCBITaxon_50557 obo:NCBITaxon_43741'><span id='am-50' property="rdfs:label" content="This" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-51'  ></span><span id='am-52' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-53' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span>This</span> process starts with the               export in yeast that uses a fusion between green fluorescent <br /> synthesis of two pre-rRNA transcripts, 35S and pre-5S rRNA,                 protein (GFP) and ribosomal protein Rpl25p (15).
