We previously showed that Na cooperates with the R protein to induce lytic gene expression in latently <br />           infected EBV-positive 293 cells, and in some EBV-negative cell lines it can activate the Z promoter in reporter <br />           gene assays. Here we show that overexpression of Na alone is sufficient to induce lytic gene expression in several <br />           different latently infected epithelial cell lines (Hone-Akata, CNE2-Akata, and AGS-Akata), while knockdown of <br />           endogenous Na expression reduces lytic gene expression.

Another                     <br /> potential role for p53 is to either enhance transcription factors             <br /> or inhibit transcriptional repressors involved in regulation of             <br /> Zp. Additionally, since p53 is important during HDACi-in-                            <br /> duced lytic infection (12), p53 may play a role in regulating            <br /> histone modifications and thereby affect regulation of lytic                          <br /> gene transcription. Alternatively, since a number of recent              <br /> studies have suggested that p53 plays an important role in the                    <br /> regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) (59), it is possible that                          <br /> the effect of p53 on lytic reactivation is at least partially medi-            <br /> ated through this mechanism. For example, the miRNAs 200b                <br /> and 429, which reduce the level of the Zp cellular repressor                        <br /> proteins ZEB-1 and ZEB-2, have been shown to enhance lytic               <br /> gene expression (21). Interestingly, although p53 function ap-                     <br /> pears to promote activation of Z transcription during the initial          <br /> steps of viral reactivation, the Z protein subsequently acts to           <br /> inhibit p53 function through multiple mechanisms (including                         <br /> targeting p53 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, as well as                <br /> inhibiting its transcriptional function) (48, 54a). Thus, the role      <br /> of p53 during lytic EBV reactivation is complex and may be                            <br /> quite different during the early versus late stages of infection.                 <br /> Our results here suggest that the p53 status of different cell                    <br /> lines likely plays an important factor in determining if Na                           <br /> expression results in viral reactivation.                                    <br />    Although we have shown here that Na overexpression in                       <br /> certain EBV-infected epithelial cell lines is sufficient to induce            <br /> lytic protein expression (particularly in conjunction with p53),                    <br /> we nevertheless have consistently found that the Z and R                              <br /> proteins induce lytic protein expression more efficiently than                   <br /> the Na protein in all cell lines tested. Thus, activation of the Z          <br /> and/or R promoters by cellular transcription factors likely plays                 <br /> a more important role than activation of the Na promoter in                     <br /> promoting lytic infection in virally infected epithelial cells.                  <br /> Since the EBV-infected epithelial cell lines that respond to the             <br /> lytic-inducing effect of Na alone can constitutively express lytic              <br /> EBV proteins at a very low level, it remains possible that an                      <br /> important aspect of the Na lytic induction effect is to enhance           <br /> R-mediated and/or Z-mediated transcriptional effects.
