Briefly, a C. albicans genomic library, consisting of 4.9 &#11003; 104   at 30 &#176;C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min <br /> independent clones (44), was mutagenized by transposon insertion in vitro. A       followed by three washes in PBS. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and cell <br /> hyperactive C9 mariner transposase was purified as a fusion with maltose           densities were determined by hemacytometer count and additionally con- <br /> binding protein, and transposition conditions were optimized according to          firmed by OD600 comparison for PES1-depleted cultures in which yeast cells <br /> considerations described in ref. 45. The transposon was adapted to contain the     formed aggregates of unseparated yeast. Final dilutions for injection of 106 <br /> CaNAT1 marker, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside nourseothri-         cells were prepared in PBS. Sixteen larvae (330 &#11006; 25 mg) were used per group <br /> cin on C. albicans and on <span id='am-81' about='obo:NCBITaxon_562' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_561 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_91347 obo:NCBITaxon_1224 obo:NCBITaxon_2 obo:NCBITaxon_543 obo:NCBITaxon_1236'><span id='am-82' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="bacterium E3" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-83' property="oboInOwl:hasAlternativeId" content="NCBITaxon:662101" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-84' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Bacterium coli commune" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-85'  ></span><span id='am-86' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:11" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-87' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Eschericia coli" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-88' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Escherchia coli" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-89' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="Escherichia/Shigella coli" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-90' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="PMID:10319482" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-91' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-92' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Bacterium coli" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-93' property="rdfs:label" content="Escherichia coli" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-94' property="oboInOwl:hasAlternativeId" content="NCBITaxon:662104" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-95' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Enterococcus coli" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-96' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Bacillus coli" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Escherichia coli</span> (42).
