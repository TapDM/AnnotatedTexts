This scenario is different from the mitotic       ture. Like other mutations that affect microtubule assembly, <br /> arrest that results from microtubule disassembly induced             tubg1 mutant alleles might block the progression of an- <br /> either by treatment with microtubule-depolymerizing drugs            aphase and cytokinesis that would normally arrest cells in M <br /> (Hoyt et al., 1991; Li and Murray, 1991) or by mutations in          phase. To our surprise, none of our mutants showed a <br /> &#9252;-tubulin (Hiraoka et al., 1984).

These surveillance mechanisms, which monitor <br /> the timely and proper progression of the cell cycle are called        <br /> checkpoints (Hartwell and Weinert, 1989). Two prominent <br /> checkpoints that monitor mitosis are the spindle assembly            <br /> checkpoint (reviewed in Amon, 1999) and the exit from                <br /> mitosis (reviewed in Cerutti and Simanis, 1999; Balasubra-           <br /> manian et al., 2000; Hoyt, 2000). This system of mitotic             <br /> checkpoints has been well elucidated in the budding yeast             <br /> and homologs have been identified in other systems, includ-          <br /> ing fission yeast, Xenopus, and mammalian systems (re-               <br /> viewed in Amon, 1999). The spindle checkpoint monitors               <br /> attachment of the sister chromatids to properly assembled            <br /> spindle microtubules, thereby preventing premature an-                <br /> aphase from occurring. One of the major players involved in           <br /> this system of checkpoints is a spindle pole protein, Cdc16p         <br /> (the fission yeast homolog of Bub2p). Cdc16p is a negative           <br /> regulator of the septation initiation pathway involved in <br /> ensuring that sister chromatids are properly segregated to <br /> opposite poles before the cells undergo septation, signaling <br /> exit from mitosis (Fankhauser et al., 1993). Cdc16p is also <br /> required to prevent septation from occurring during inter-          <br /> phase (Cerutti and Simanis, 1999). Mutations in &#9253;-tubulin, <br />                                                                      <br /> particularly tubg1-13, are reminiscent of mutations in the <br />                                                                      <br /> genes, such as cdc16&#11001;, involved in the septation initiation          <br /> pathway (reviewed in Gould and Simanis, 1997). The <br /> tubg1-13 phenotype of septum formation without cytokine-              <br /> sis is also similar to that of ppb1 (Yoshida et al., 1994) and        <br /> sep1 (Sipiczki et al., 1993), both of which are also defective in     <br /> cytokinesis. Thus, these data suggest that &#9253;-tubulin may be           <br /> involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint that prevents <br />                                                                     <br /> sister chromatid separation and cytokinesis in response to            <br /> spindle damage. <br />    &#9253;-Tubulin is required for the nucleation of microtubule           <br /> assembly in vivo in mammalian cells (Joshi et al., 1992) and          <br /> for spindle assembly and function in S. pombe, S. cerevisiae, A.      <br /> nidulans, and Drosophila (Oakley et al., 1990; Horio et al., 1991;    <br /> Sobel and Snyder, 1995; Sunkel et al., 1995; Spang et al., 1996; <br /> </body></html>
