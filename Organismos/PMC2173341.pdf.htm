Unlike mu- <br /> tant alleles of SPC42, different mutant alleles of MPS1, <br /> which encodes a dual specificity protein kinase required for <br /> SPB duplication, fail at two distinct points in SPB duplica- <br /> tion (Winey et al., 1991; Lauze et al., 1995; Schutz and <br /> Winey, 1998). This suggests that Mps1p is required for <br /> multiple events in SPB duplication.                                Figure 1.
