The enzyme catalyzes two distinct but functionally related reactions required for the <br />          DNA processing events associated with conjugation: the site- and strand-specific transesterification (relaxase) <br />          reaction that provides the nick required to initiate strand transfer and a processive 5&#11541;-to-3&#11541; helicase reaction <br />          that provides the motive force for strand transfer. Previous studies have identified the relaxase domain, which <br />          encompasses the first &#11011;310 amino acids of the protein. The helicase-associated motifs lie between amino acids <br />          990 and 1450. The function of the region between amino acids 310 and 990 and the region from amino acid 1450 <br />          to the C-terminal end is unknown. A protein lacking the C-terminal 252 amino acids (TraI&#9004;252) was <br />          constructed and shown to have essentially wild-type levels of transesterase and helicase activity. In addition, <br />          the protein was capable of a functional interaction with other components of the minimal relaxosome. However, <br />          TraI&#9004;252 was not able to support conjugative DNA transfer in genetic complementation experiments. We <br />          conclude that TraI&#9004;252 lacks an essential C-terminal domain that is required for DNA transfer. We speculate <br />          <span id='am-34' about='obo:NCBITaxon_169495' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_33340 obo:NCBITaxon_33213 obo:NCBITaxon_169440 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_7147 obo:NCBITaxon_43733 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_43738 obo:NCBITaxon_480117 obo:NCBITaxon_33317 obo:NCBITaxon_169449 obo:NCBITaxon_480118 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_6072 obo:NCBITaxon_6960 obo:NCBITaxon_43750 obo:NCBITaxon_33208 obo:NCBITaxon_85512 obo:NCBITaxon_197562 obo:NCBITaxon_197563 obo:NCBITaxon_7203 obo:NCBITaxon_6656 obo:NCBITaxon_7496 obo:NCBITaxon_1206794 obo:NCBITaxon_88770 obo:NCBITaxon_33392 obo:NCBITaxon_169455 obo:NCBITaxon_50557 obo:NCBITaxon_43741'><span id='am-35' property="rdfs:label" content="This" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-36'  ></span><span id='am-37' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-38' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span>this</span> domain may be involved in essential protein-protein interactions with other components of the DNA <br />          transfer machinery. <br />  <br />  <br />    Conjugative DNA strand transfer is a highly conserved                   phodiester backbone at nic via a transesterification reaction <br /> mechanism for unidirectional transfer of genetic information               that leaves the initiator protein covalently bound on the 5&#11032; end <br /> among bacteria of the same <span id='am-44' about='obo:NCBITaxon_species' typeof='owl:Thing NCBITaxon:_taxonomic_rank'><span id='am-45' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-46' property="rdfs:label" content="species" datatype="xsd:string"></span>species</span>, from one species to an-                of the cleaved DNA strand via a phosphotyrosyl linkage.

Therefore, expression is relatively low <br /> and we estimate less than threefold greater than expression <br /> from the mini-F plasmid (Fig. 2B). Thus, high-level expression <br /> of TraI is not required for genetic complementation. A point <br /> mutation in the active site tyrosine of the transesterase domain <br /> (TraIY16V) or a point mutation in helicase motif I of the <br /> helicase domain (TraIK998M) abolishes genetic complemen- <br /> tation as reported previously (6, 28; unpublished results). In- <br /> terestingly, deletion of the C-terminal 252 amino acids also <br /> abolishes genetic complementation, suggesting that this region <br /> of the protein is essential for some aspect of the DNA transfer <br /> event. It is important to note that this truncation leaves all <br /> helicase-associated motifs intact. <br />    TraI&#9004;252 maintains essentially wild-type helicase and <br /> transesterase activity. To eliminate the possibility that <br /> TraI&#9004;252 was unable to support CDT due to an impact on <br /> either helicase activity or relaxase activity, the purified protein <br /> was evaluated in biochemical assays for both activities. The <br /> helicase activity of the protein was tested with a 93-bp partial <br /> duplex DNA substrate and an 851-bp partial duplex DNA <br /> substrate (Fig. 3). Helicase activity measured with a 93-bp <br /> partial duplex substrate was reduced slightly compared to the <br /> activity of the full-length protein at low protein concentrations. <br /> However, at higher protein concentrations, the activity of <br /> TraI&#9004;252 was virtually indistinguishable from that of full- <br /> length protein. Similarly, TraI&#9004;252-catalzyed helicase activity <br /> on the longer partial duplex substrate (851 bp) was reduced <br /> relative to that of full-length protein at low protein concentra- <br /> tions but was only slightly lower than that of full-length protein <br /> at higher protein concentrations. Importantly, the protein ex- <br /> hibits robust helicase activity on both substrates, suggesting the <br /> failure to complement in genetic assays is not due to a loss of <br /> DNA helicase activity. <br />    The transesterase activity of the protein was also evaluated <br /> in a series of biochemical activity assays. Previous studies have <br /> shown that TraI catalyzes the &#8220;nicking&#8221; of a plasmid containing          FIG. 3. DNA helicase activity of TraI and TraI&#9004;252.

TraI&#9004;252 is capable of assembling into a functional relaxo-                     <br /> some. The relaxosome reconstitution experiments were performed as                      <br />                                                                                   <br /> described in Materials and Methods with the indicated proteins at the                  <br /> following concentrations: TraI (TraI&#9004;252), 62.5 nM; IHF, 49.4 nM;                  <br /> and TraY, 170 nM. The positions of relaxed and supercoiled DNA are           <br /> indicated on the left. Lane 7 contains a linear DNA marker that                          <br /> migrates just slightly faster than nicked DNA on an agarose gel.                         <br /> here that loss of the C-terminal extension on TraI does indeed                    <br />                                                                                       <br /> abate DNA transfer. Previous studies (34) have shown that loss                   <br /> of the C-terminal extension on TraD also significantly reduces                     <br /> F-plasmid DNA transfer. Further studies will be required to                           <br />                                                                           <br /> determine if TraD and TraI do, in fact, interact and if the                      <br /> C-terminal extensions on each protein are responsible for that                   <br />                                                                                  <br /> interaction.                                                                            <br />    In summary, the C-terminal region on F-plasmid-encoded                        <br /> TraI represents a third functional domain of the protein that is         <br /> required for CDT. The relaxase domain and the helicase do-                        <br /> main are necessary but not sufficient to support the DNA                     <br /> transfer event. We speculate that the C-terminal domain is a                  <br /> protein-protein interaction domain and that either TraM or                 <br /> TraD (or both) interacts with TraI to relax the plasmid in                   <br /> preparation for transfer of ssDNA and to mediate the inter-                          <br /> action of the active relaxosome with the secretion apparatus at                     <br /> the cell envelop.                                                                        <br /> </body></html>
