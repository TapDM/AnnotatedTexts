Fatica, M. Dlakic and D. Tollervey <br />  <br /> ABSTRACT <br /> Box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs) contain four essential proteins, Cbf5p, Gar1p, <br /> Nhp2p, and Nop10p, each of which, with the exception of Gar1p, is required for box H/ACA snoRNA accumulation. <br /> Database searches identified a novel essential protein, which we termed Naf1p, with a region of homology to the <br /> RNA-binding domain of Gar1p and other features in common with hnRNP-like proteins. Naf1p is localized to the <br /> nucleus and is not a stable component of the H/ACA snoRNPs, but it is required for the accumulation of all box H/ACA <br /> snoRNAs. <span id='am-90' about='obo:NCBITaxon_169495' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_33340 obo:NCBITaxon_33213 obo:NCBITaxon_169440 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_7147 obo:NCBITaxon_43733 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_43738 obo:NCBITaxon_480117 obo:NCBITaxon_33317 obo:NCBITaxon_169449 obo:NCBITaxon_480118 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_6072 obo:NCBITaxon_6960 obo:NCBITaxon_43750 obo:NCBITaxon_33208 obo:NCBITaxon_85512 obo:NCBITaxon_197562 obo:NCBITaxon_197563 obo:NCBITaxon_7203 obo:NCBITaxon_6656 obo:NCBITaxon_7496 obo:NCBITaxon_1206794 obo:NCBITaxon_88770 obo:NCBITaxon_33392 obo:NCBITaxon_169455 obo:NCBITaxon_50557 obo:NCBITaxon_43741'><span id='am-91' property="rdfs:label" content="This" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-92'  ></span><span id='am-93' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-94' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span>This</span> requirement is not at the level of snoRNA transcription initiation or termination.
