We found that GR resides in both cytosolic and <br />           organellar fractions of the cell. Depletion of GR lowered the respiration rate and the activity of oxidation-labile <br />           Fe-S enzymes such as mitochondrial aconitase and cytosolic sulfite reductase. Trx2 did not reverse the high <br />           ratio of oxidized glutathione to GSH or the low respiration rate observed in GR-depleted cells. However, it <br />           brought the activity of oxidation-labile Fe-S enzymes to a normal level, suggesting that the maintenance of Fe-S <br />           enzymes is a critical factor in the survival of S. pombe. The activity of succinate dehydrogenase, an oxidation- <br />           insensitive Fe-S enzyme, however, was not affected by GR depletion, suggesting that GR is not required for the <br />           biogenesis of the Fe-S cluster. The total iron content was greatly increased by GR depletion and was brought <br />           to a nearly normal level by Trx2. These results indicate that the essentiality of GR in the aerobic growth of S. <br />           pombe is derived from its role in maintaining oxidation-labile Fe-S enzymes and iron homeostasis. <br />  <br />  <br />    The abundant tripeptide glutathione (GSH) (L-&#9253;-glutamyl-                       As thiol buffer molecules, GSH, Grx, and Trx share some <br /> L-cysteinylglycin) is one of the most prevalent reducing thiols                overlapping functions.

Some components of the respira-         Trx2 in this process. <br /> tory chain complexes can be the target of ROS (41). In this <br /> study, we found that GR depletion caused a drastic decrease in                                  <br /> the respiration rate, which was not recovered by Trx2 overpro- <br />                                                                        <br /> duction. Accumulation of GSSG (or a high GSSG/GSH ratio)             <br /> in mitochondria could cause the oxidation of several thiol-         <br /> containing proteins such as the permeability transition pore          <br /> (13), respiratory chain molecules, or tricarboxylic acid (TCA)       <br /> cycle enzymes. There are reports that GSH depletion causes a                                           <br /> loss of complex I activity through thiol oxidation (41, 51). The <br />                                                                   <br /> redox-active thiols in complex I react with GSSG and form                <br /> mixed disulfides in a Grx-dependent manner, thus causing the             <br /> inhibition of complex I activity and an increase in ROS gen-             <br /> eration (2, 51). Supplementation with thioredoxin or GSH                <br /> reduces the mixed disulfides but does not restore the activity of        <br /> complex I. Respiratory dysfunction can result from the inacti-        <br /> vation of enzymes in the TCA cycle as well. When NADH is                <br /> not supplied efficiently from the TCA cycle, the electron flow        <br /> in the respiratory chain is blocked. We found that aconitase, a        <br /> key enzyme in the TCA cycle, lost activity in GR-deficient cells.     <br /> It could have caused a decrease in the respiration rate. How-            <br /> ever, the restoration of aconitase activity by Trx2 failed to           <br /> increase the respiration rate, suggesting that not the decrease        <br /> in respiration but a function related with aconitase activity is          <br /> what caused the growth defect in GR-deficient S. pombe cells.      <br />    Aconitase possesses an Fe-S cluster that is labile to oxidative      <br /> attack. Since aconitase activity is greatly affected by GR defi-   <br /> ciency, it can be hypothesized that either an increased ROS          <br /> level or inefficient Fe-S maintenance results from a GR defi-     <br /> ciency. Our preliminary observation revealed no change in           <br /> protein carbonylation upon GR depletion, an indication of the      <br /> oxidative environment in the cell, suggesting that the absence            <br /> of GR does not increase the level of ROS but could impair            <br /> Fe-S maintenance (data not shown). It is not plausible that the         <br /> GR depletion impaired the generation of the Fe-S cluster,               <br /> since succinate dehydrogenase activity was not affected by the          <br /> GR depletion. Instead, the GR- and Trx2-dependent behavior                <br /> of sulfite reductase as well as aconitase indicates that GR is           <br /> required to maintain the Fe-S cluster in mitochondria as well       <br /> as in the cytosol.
