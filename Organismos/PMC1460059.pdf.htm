To identify factors that impinge upon Cdc1 or the Cdc1-dependent process, we isolated second- <br />               site suppressors of the conditional cdc1-1(Ts) growth defect. Recessive suppressors define 15 COS (CdcOne <br />               Suppressor) genes. Seven of the fifteen COS genes are required for biogenesis of the vacuole, an organelle <br />               known to sequester intracellular Mn21 . An eighth gene, COS16, encodes a vacuolar membrane protein <br />               that seems to be involved in Mn2 1 homeostasis. These results suggest mutations that block vacuolar Mn2 1 <br />               sequestration compensate for defects in Cdc1 function. Interestingly, Cdc1 is dispensable in a cos16D <br />               deletion strain, and a cdc1D cos16D double mutant exhibits robust growth on medium supplemented with <br />               Mn2 1. Thus, the single, essential function of Cdc1 is to regulate intracellular, probably cytosolic, Mn21. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> C     ELLS of the yeast <span id='am-23' about='obo:NCBITaxon_4930' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_4751 obo:NCBITaxon_4893 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_451864 obo:NCBITaxon_4892 obo:NCBITaxon_4891 obo:NCBITaxon_4890 obo:NCBITaxon_716545 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_147537'><span id='am-24' property="oboInOwl:hasAlternativeId" content="NCBITaxon:36915" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-25' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-26' property="rdfs:label" content="Saccharomyces" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-27' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-28'  ></span><span id='am-29' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Pachytichospora" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Saccharomyces</span> cerevisiae divide by <br />        budding.

First, <br /> gous cdc1D::HIS3/C DC1 COS16/COS16 (FY 1) or cdc1D::HIS3/         Cos16 is an integral membrane protein of the vacuole, <br /> C DC1 cos16D::LEU2/COS16 (FY 1 cos16D::LEU2) diploids were        as judged by the subcellular localization pattern of a <br /> sporulated and dissected onto rich yeast medium with, or with-    functional Cos16-LacZ fusion protein (Figure 5). This <br /> out, Mn21 supplement (see materials and methods).

(a, b, c, and d refer to individual spores of   ing region. Thus, Cos16 is appropriately positioned to <br /> a tedrad.)                                                        affect transport between the cytosol and vacuole. Sec- <br />                                                                   ond, a cos16D deletion suppresses the chelator sensitivity <br />                                                                   of a strain (smf1D) compromised for Mn21 uptake into <br />                                                                   the cytosol (Figure 6C), suggesting that loss of Cos16 <br /> We show here that, in certain genetic backgrounds, Mn21           function compensates for the low influx into the cytosol. <br /> supplement completely bypasses the essential Cdc1 re-             cos16 mutations also relieve the chelator sensitivity of a <br /> quirement. Indeed, a cdc1D cos16D double mutant exhibits          mutant (pmr1D) that can be efficiently suppressed by <br /> robust growth when the medium is supplemented with                genetic manipulations that raise cytosolic Mn21 (Figure <br /> Mn21 (Figure 7). Because COS16 is also involved in intra-         6B; Paidhungat and Garrett 1998). Finally, Cos16 <br /> cellular Mn21 homeostasis, these results are best explained       inactivation exacerbates the Mn21 sensitivity of both <br /> by a model in which Mn21 regulation is the single, essential      wild-type (data not shown) and pmr1D mutant strains <br /> function of Cdc1. These results also rule out the possibility     (Figure 6A), presumably by aggravating the accumula- <br /> that the Mn21 dependence of cdc1 strains reflects the fact        tion of cytosolic Mn21. Thus, Cos16 appears to antago- <br /> that Cdc1 is a Mn21-dependent enzyme (Supek et al. 1996;          nize the cdc1(Ts) growth defect by sequestering cytosolic <br /> Paidhungat and Garrett 1998).

A previous <br /> Mn21. Mn21 depletion from the Golgi elicits a protein             report (Okorokov et al. 1977) suggested that most intra- <br /> glycosylation defect not observed in the cdc1(Ts) mu-             cellular Mn21 is found in the vacuole. According to that <br /> tants, and the cdc1(Ts) growth defect is exacerbated,             report, a defect in cytosolic Mn21 retention, as predicted <br /> not alleviated, by alterations that increase Mn21 flux            for cdc1(Ts) mutants, might not affect total intracellular <br /> from the cytosol to the Golgi (Paidhungat and Gar-                Mn21 content. However, it is harder to reconcile the fact <br /> rett 1998). Thus, we suggested that the cytosol, rather           that the cos16D deletion did not alter the level of intracellu- <br /> than the Golgi apparatus, was the more likely site of             lar Mn21. We can think of several possible explanations <br /> cdc1(Ts) Mn21 depletion (Paidhungat and Garrett                   for this apparent paradox. First, Cos16 might either be <br /> 1998). Another major intracellular Mn21 store is the              involved in the regulation of other ions, or affect an organ- <br /> vacuole (Okorokov et al. 1977). Although the vacuole              elle that might copurify with the vacuole. Although we <br /> is known to play a role in Mn21 detoxification, nothing           have not formally ruled out these possibilities, they do not <br /> is known about the cellular function(s) of the vacuolar           easily account for the observation that cos16 mutations <br /> Mn21 pool. However, mutations that inhibit vacuolar               affect the growth of Mn21 homeostasis mutants. Alterna- <br /> biogenesis (and function) at several distinct steps sup-          tively, Cos16 inactivation might block cytosolic to vacuole <br /> press, rather than exacerbate, the cdc1(Ts) growth de-            Mn21 transfer without having a measurable effect on vacu- <br /> fect. Suppression of conditional growth probably results          olar Mn21 content. <br />  <br />  <br />    Finally, along with COS16 and the vacuolar biogenesis                 <br />                                                                            <br /> genes characterized in this study, we identified several                    <br /> other suppressors of the cdc1(Ts) growth defect. One                              <br /> suppressor, cos13, falls within the same phenotypic and                   <br />                                                                      <br /> epistasis group as cos16 and might, therefore, identify                         <br /> a component of a complex or pathway involved in vacuo-                      <br /> lar Mn21 homeostasis. By contrast, the remaining reces-            <br /> sive suppressors (cos1, cos3, cos14, cos2, cos7, and cos10)         <br /> confer phenotypes that are not obviously related to                          <br /> Mn21 regulation. Thus, the genes corresponding to                <br /> these suppressors might specify receptors of the Cdc1            <br /> (and Mn21?)-dependent growth process. Future studies                  <br /> of these genes might help elucidate the role of Cdc1                          <br /> in Mn21 homeostasis and growth.                                             <br /> </body></html>
