One could speculate that either end-           <br /> joining process would require the alignment of broken         <br /> DSB ends that may be easier to facilitate if both ends        <br /> are tightly bound by the cohesin complex to the intact         <br /> sister chromatid that would thus act as a sca&#64256;old to            <br /> indirectly promote repair. Figure 5 suggests that        <br /> cohesin-dependent enhancement of repair in the G2              <br /> phase occurs with and without DNA-PK inhibition but        <br /> it appears to depend on functional ATM. This &#64257;nding            <br /> suggests that cohesin may promote DSB repair via at             <br /> least one additional pathway to DNA-PK-dependent            <br /> end-joining but, given that both ATM and DNA-PK                 <br /> in&#64258;uence both homologous recombination and end-              <br /> joining pathways (47), these data do not clarify which    <br /> one or both of the discussed pathways are involved.            <br /> Also, more detailed analysis of DSB repair kinetics          <br /> would be required to better clarify the interaction of          <br /> cohesin with ATM and DNA-PK and its contribution to           <br /> speci&#64257;c repair pathways. The ATM and DNA-PK              <br /> inhibitors are highly selective and e&#64256;ective at the            <br /> concentrations used (23,24). They are being widely used      <br /> and no non-speci&#64257;c e&#64256;ects have been reported to date.        <br /> Given that, in addition, Rad21 knock-down was very e&#64259;-        <br /> cient (Figure 5E) and similar results were obtained for          <br /> Rad21 and SMC1, it is therefore unlikely that the         <br /> observed e&#64256;ects are due to combinations of partial              <br /> inhibitions and/or o&#64256;-target e&#64256;ects.                         <br />    Notably, the moderate size of the e&#64256;ect of cohesin          <br /> depletion on DSB repair observed here in G2-phase cells          <br /> is similar to that observed for a number of factors,     <br /> including ATM, Artemis, NBS1, H2AX, 53BP1 and               <br /> others observed in G1-phase cells (48). Our &#64257;nding that         <br /> cohesin-dependent enhancement of DSB repair in G2             <br /> requires ATM (Figure 5) indicates that they may act in        <br /> the same pathway in this cell cycle phase. Additional work       <br /> is required, however, to determine whether there is indeed       <br /> a functional link between these observations.                <br /> </body></html>
