It has, in fact, recently been      <br /> shown that gene 2.5 protein facilitates the renaturation of                 <br /> single-stranded DNA much more efficiently that does E. coli              <br /> SSB, recA, or T4 gene 32 protein (S. Tabor and C.C.R.,                        <br /> unpublished results). Such an activity is likely to be impor-     <br /> tant for catalysis of homologous pairing and may provide an                   <br /> explanation for the essential role of the protein in vivo in               <br /> recombination (8, 9).                                                      <br />    By what mechanism would a defect in recombination lead                     <br /> to the severe defect in replication observed in cells infected          <br /> with the gene 2.S 17 mutant? One possibility is that, in the           <br /> absence of gene 2.5 protein and the catalysis of homologous               <br /> pairing, recombination intermediates accumulate and are                   <br /> subsequently degraded. On the other hand, it is quite likely                <br />                                                                        <br /> that recombination plays an essential role in T7 DNA repli-               <br /> cation. The genome of bacteriophage T7 is replicated through       <br /> exclusively linear intermediates (concatemers) (48, 49). For-       <br /> mation of concatemers provides an intermediate by which the                   <br /> 3&apos; ends of the 17 chromosome can be replicated. Concate-                  <br /> mers can then be processed to yield fully replicated duplex              <br /> chromosomes (50, 51). All evidence indicates that concate-                   <br /> mers are formed in vivo by annealing single-stranded termi-                <br /> nally redundant ends of replication intermediates (28). We                <br /> propose that the gene 2.5 protein is required for rapid and           <br /> efficient homologous pairing of the exposed terminal redun-                   <br /> dancy in phage-infected cells. In the absence of concatemer           <br /> formation, subsequent DNA synthesis may well be defective,                <br />                                                                           <br /> terminating after replication of the parental DNA. This one               <br /> round of DNA synthesis would represent only 1% or less of                <br /> the total DNA synthesis usually observed in phage-infected                    <br /> cells. In this regard, concatemer formation in phage T7-                  <br /> infected cells requires recombination (52, 53).                                <br /> </body></html>
