Hence, there is a need for supple- <br />           menting the current set of malaria vaccine candidate antigens. Here, we aimed to characterize glycosylphos- <br />           phatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored micronemal antigen (GAMA) encoded by the PF08_0008 gene in Plasmodium <br />           falciparum. Antibodies were raised against recombinant GAMA synthesized by using a wheat germ cell-free <br />           system. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated for the first time that GAMA is a microneme protein of the <br />           merozoite. Erythrocyte binding assays revealed that GAMA possesses an erythrocyte binding epitope in the <br />           C-terminal region and it binds a nonsialylated protein receptor on human erythrocytes. Growth inhibition <br />           assays revealed that anti-GAMA antibodies can inhibit P. falciparum invasion in a dose-dependent manner and <br />           GAMA plays a role in the sialic acid (SA)-independent invasion pathway. Anti-GAMA antibodies in combi- <br />           nation with anti-erythrocyte binding antigen 175 exhibited a significantly higher level of invasion inhibition, <br />           supporting the rationale that targeting of both SA-dependent and SA-independent ligands/pathways is better <br />           than targeting either of them alone. Human sera collected from areas of malaria endemicity in Mali and <br />           Thailand recognized GAMA. Since GAMA in P. falciparum is refractory to gene knockout attempts, it is <br />           essential to parasite invasion. Overall, our study indicates that GAMA is a novel blood-stage vaccine candidate <br />           antigen. <br />  <br />  <br />    <span id='am-24' about='obo:NCBITaxon_5833' typeof='obo:NCBITaxon_5820 owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_5794 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_418107 obo:NCBITaxon_422676 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_5819 obo:NCBITaxon_33630'><span id='am-25'  ></span><span id='am-26' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Plasmodium (Laverania) falciparum" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-27' property="rdfs:label" content="Plasmodium falciparum" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-28' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-29' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-30' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="malaria parasite P. falciparum" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Plasmodium falciparum</span> is the causative agent of the most                     dramatically in recent years, in large part due to the renewed <br /> burdensome form of human malaria, affecting about 225 mil-                      focus on control, local elimination, and eventual global eradi- <br /> lion individuals and killing about 0.8 million individuals in 2009              cation efforts (3).
