One <br />                                                                      mM ammonium acetate to the cultures (Fig. 4B), although <br /> gln-71 glnKY51F amtB3::Tetr transformant was named MV577, <br />                                                                      there was no increase in the rate of MV578, which may indicate <br /> and one corresponding glnK&#11001; transformant was named MV578 <br />                                                                      effects of GlnKY51F on other cellular functions in N-rich me- <br /> (Fig. 1). These results support the hypothesis that GlnK-UMP <br /> is required for control of GS activity, almost certainly by sig- <br /> naling deadenylylation of GS by ATase/AR. Importantly, they <br /> also indicate that MV72 could probably be used as a host strain <br /> to study the role of GlnK in the regulation of NifA activity in <br /> A. vinelandii. <br />    glnKY51F encodes a protein which cannot be uridylylated. <br /> To test whether the GlnKY51F protein could be modified by <br /> uridylylation, glnKY51F and wild-type glnK were expressed in <br /> E. coli from plasmids pPR113 and pPR115 (see Materials and <br /> Methods). These two plasmids express the complete GlnK or <br /> GlnKY51F proteins fused to a six-residue N-terminal His tag. <br /> Since E. coli expresses GlnB and GlnK which can be uridyly- <br /> lated, a strain was constructed that lacked both glnB and glnK <br /> (CK1007) or glnB glnK and glnD (CK1008) (see Materials and <br /> Methods) (Table 1). For the uridylylation experiments, strains <br /> CK1007 and CK1008 carrying either pPR113 or pPR115 were <br /> grown to mid-log phase in LB or LB plus glutamine (100 <br /> &#9262;g/ml), and expression of GlnK or GlnKHis6 was induced from <br /> the plasmid with 0.5 mM IPTG. In extracts, GlnKHis6 could be <br /> uridylylated in a GlnD-dependent fashion while GlnKY51FHis6 <br /> could not (Fig. 3, bottom). Western blotting of the extracts <br /> used in the uridylylation experiments indicated that both plas- <br /> mids expressed stable proteins which cross-reacted with E. coli <br /> PII antisera (Fig. 3, top) (gift from W. vanHeeswijk). In the <br /> upper panel of Fig. 3 it is also evident that GlnKY51F is not <br /> detected at the same level as GlnK. This may be because the <br /> level of expression from pPR115 is lower or that the Y51F <br /> mutation disrupts a region of important antigenicity. <br />    Uridylylated GlnK is required for growth in N-free media <br /> and for NifA activity. MV577 (glnKY51F amtB3::Tetr gln-71) <br /> formed only very small colonies on N-free medium, indicating <br /> that the glnKY51F mutation affected nitrogen fixation and/or <br /> assimilation (data not shown).

Finding <br /> inhibition can be partially relieved by a reduction in fixed         these targets may explain the apparent essentiality of this pro- <br /> nitrogen, perhaps by the binding of 2-oxoglutarate (28) or           tein and have implications for all other organisms whose ge- <br /> other mechanisms affecting GlnK activity.                            nomes contain one or more homologs of this interesting group <br />    As has been proposed for A. vinelandii and other organisms        of signal transduction proteins. <br /> which probably have only one PII-like protein, the composition <br /> of A. vinelandii GlnK may be an amalgam of residues such that                                <br /> a single protein can function with all regulatory targets (2). In      <br /> light of this, it is also not surprising that while GlnK of A.     <br /> vinelandii and GlnK of E. coli are more similar (83% identity)      <br />                                                                     <br /> than are A. vinelandii GlnK and E. coli GlnB (75% identity), <br />                                                                     <br /> the T-loop region of A. vinelandii GlnK containing Y51 is more        <br /> characteristic of GlnB proteins (3). This may be why E. coli         <br /> GlnB and A. vinelandii GlnK apparently interact with NifL <br />                                                                                                     <br /> while E. coli GlnK does not (28). If GlnK is an essential protein <br />                                                                      <br /> in A. vinelandii, its rapid uridylylation in response to nitrogen        <br /> flux mediates protein activities and would rely less on changes         <br /> in the level of GlnK by transcriptional control. This is consis-        <br />                                                                     <br /> tent with the observation that neither glnA (encoding GS) nor         <br /> nifL gene expression is regulated by NH4&#11001; in A. vinelandii (8,         <br /> 43). In contrast, K. pneumoniae harbors two PII-like proteins,     <br />                                                                       <br /> probably because they provide a selective advantage over a              <br /> single protein. In this organism, PII (GlnB), whose expression <br /> is not regulated by nitrogen status, may be specific for targets        <br /> involved in more subtle environmental tuning. GlnK, on the              <br /> other hand, may be specific to nitrogen fixation and/or severe         <br />                                                                      <br /> N starvation responses. In this scenario, it would seem suffi-         <br /> cient to express glnK in the absence of combined nitrogen to          <br /> activate NifA, which has been suggested for K. pneumoniae          <br />                                                                     <br /> (20, 23) and for E. coli (44).                                   <br />    Unmodified GlnK interacts with NifL in a yeast two-hybrid          <br />                                                                       <br /> assay. In this work it was proposed that A. vinelandii GlnK          <br /> might exert its effects directly on the NifL.
