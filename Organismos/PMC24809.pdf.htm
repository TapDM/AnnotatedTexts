The <br /> observation that SV2 binds the extracellular matrix protein <br /> laminin (8) suggested that it could participate in the formation <br /> of synapses or the establishment of active zones. To determine <br /> whether the reduced neurotransmission in SV2A knockouts is <br /> caused by changes in synapse density and&#20862;or morphology, syn- <br /> apses were analyzed at the electron microscopic level. Two areas <br /> of the CA3 region of the hippocampus were chosen for exami- <br /> nation: the CA3 pyramidal neuron cell-body layer and the <br /> proximal region of CA3 apical dendrites. CA3 cell bodies receive <br /> inhibitory input from GABAergic interneurons via symmetric <br /> synapses (26), whereas proximal dendrites receive mossy fiber <br /> input from dentate granule neurons via asymmetric, presumed <br /> excitatory synapses (27). These synapses express SV2A primarily <br /> or exclusively (10, 28) and, therefore, were predicted to be <br /> especially affected by the SV2A gene disruption. Visual inspec- <br /> tion of micrographs revealed no differences in the density or <br /> morphology of either synapse type (Fig. 6). <br />    Quantitative structural analyses were performed on the more <br /> numerous mossy fiber synapses onto proximal dendrites of CA3 <br /> pyramidal neurons. As listed in Table 1, synapse density was <br /> similar in wild type and SV2A knockouts, indicating that loss of <br /> SV2A does not affect the establishment or pruning of these <br /> synapses. Synapse morphology was also not significantly altered. <br /> We found no difference in the size of synaptic boutons, active <br /> zone length, postsynaptic density thickness, or in the clustering <br /> of vesicles (measured as the number of vesicles per unit area). It <br /> remains possible that SV2A plays a role in the strengthening of <br /> synapses and that the effects of the mutation on this function are <br /> not apparent in young animals. However, it appears that the <br /> observed phenotype of SV2A knockouts is not attributable to                     Fig. 6. Synapse morphology is normal in SV2A-knockout mice.
