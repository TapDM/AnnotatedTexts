We tried to clarify the nature of this step by searching for additional gene products that are <br />                                 specifically necessary for SOS induction following nalidixic acid treatment. A transposon library of <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                 approximately 19,000 insertion mutants yielded 18 mutants that were substantially reduced for SOS <br />                                 induction following nalidixic acid but not UV treatment, and which were also hypersensitive to <br />                                 nalidixic acid. All 18 mutants turned out to have insertions in recB or recC. As expected, recA <br />                                 insertion mutants were uncovered as being uninducible by either nalidixic acid or UV treatment. <br />                                 Insertions in 11 other genes were found to cause partial defects in SOS induction by one or both <br />                                 pathways, providing possible leads in understanding the detailed mechanisms of SOS induction. <br />                                 Overall, these results suggest that nalidixic acid-induced DNA breaks are generated either by RecBC <br />                                 itself, by redundant activities, and/or by an essential protein that could not be uncovered with <br />                                 transposon mutagenesis. <br />  <br />  <br />                            Keywords <br />                                 DNA gyrase; RecBCD; DNA damage; quinolones; transposon mutagenesis <br />  <br />  <br />                            1. Introduction <br />                                               Type II DNA topoisomerases are essential enzymes involved in numerous cellular processes, <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                               including DNA replication, DNA segregation and transcription. These enzymes catalyze <br />                                               changes in DNA topology by creating a transient double strand break in one segment of duplex <br />                                               DNA and passing a second duplex segment through that break. Many clinically important <br />                                               antibacterial and antitumor agents target type II topoisomerases by altering the equilibrium of <br />                                               the reaction cycle to stabilize the normally transient intermediate called the cleavage complex <br />                                               (Drlica and Zhao, 1997; Burden and Osheroff, 1998). These include the antibacterial <br />                                               quinolones (e.g. nalidixic acid) that target DNA gyrase (and topoisomerase IV in certain <br />                                               bacteria), and antitumor drugs such as mitoxantrone, adriamycin and etoposide, which target <br />                                               mammalian type II topoisomerase. In each case, the drug-stabilized cleavage complex consists <br />                                               of the topoisomerase linked via phosphotyrosine bonds to both 5&apos; ends of the staggered double- <br />  <br />  <br />                            * Corresponding author: Kenneth N.

Results from numerous systems demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of these <br />                                             inhibitors is dependent on formation of cleavage complexes rather than inhibition of <br />                                             topoisomerase catalytic activity (for reviews, see Chen and Liu, 1994; Drlica and Zhao, <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             1997). <br />  <br />                                             Although much research has been devoted to understanding how stabilized cleavage complexes <br />                                             lead to cell death, the detailed mechanism(s) remains unclear. Formation of cleavage <br />                                             complexes is necessary but not sufficient for cytotoxicity. The 5&apos; ends of the broken DNA <br />                                             within the cleavage complex are safely linked to protein, and cleavage complexes are readily <br />                                             reversible upon drug removal both in vivo and in vitro (Hsiang and Liu, 1989; also see Drlica <br />                                             and Zhao, 1997).

Evidently, a cellular processing event <br />                                             must occur to convert a subset of the cleavage complexes into cytotoxic lesions. What is this <br />                                             event, and what is the exact nature of the cytotoxic lesion? <br />  <br />                                             A number of observations strongly suggest that the cytotoxic lesion is some type of double- <br />                                             strand break (for review, see Chen and Liu, 1994; Drlica and Zhao, 1997). For example, <br />                                             mutational inactivation of functionally conserved recombination proteins in phage, bacterial <br />                                             and eukaryotic systems leads to drug hypersensitivity. The gene products required for the repair <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             of topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage are similar or identical to those required for the repair <br />                                             of endonuclease-generated double-strand breaks. Furthermore, there is evidence for overt <br />                                             chromosomal breaks after nalidixic acid treatment, but the location of the breaks and the <br />                                             possibility of covalently attached protein were not determined (Chen et al., 1996). <br />  <br />                                             A variety of models could in principle explain the relationship between drug-stabilized <br />                                             cleavage complexes and cytotoxicity. First, a nuclease such as SbcCD might directly recognize <br />                                             the covalent protein-DNA complex and cleave the DNA nearby (Connelly et al, 2003). Second, <br />                                             the replication complex or associated helicase may be able to extract the lagging strand template <br />                                             from the cleavage complex upon collision (Howard et al., 1994). Third, DNA breaks might <br />                                             result as &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; from recombination nucleases that act after replication fork <br />                                             blockage by the cleavage complex, as in the phage T4 system (Hong and Kreuzer 2003). We <br />                                             have recently found that quinolone-stabilized gyrase cleavage complexes block E. coli <br />                                             replication forks on plasmid pBR322 in vivo (Pohlhaus and Kreuzer, 2005). In that study, some <br />                                             of the blocked forks were broken, consistent with the collateral damage model. <br />  <br />                                             To approach the mechanism of cytotoxicity, we have taken advantage of an SOS reporter <br />                                             system and screened for E. coli mutants specifically deficient in SOS induction upon nalidixic <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             acid treatment. The primary target of nalidixic acid in E. coli is DNA gyrase (see Maxwell and <br />                                             Critchlow, 1998), and this drug was one of the first inducers of the SOS regulon studied in <br />                                             detail. The SOS regulon consists of about 30 different genes, many of which are involved in <br />                                             damage repair or bypass reactions (Friedberg et al., 1995). The LexA protein normally <br />                                             represses SOS genes, but is cleaved to trigger SOS as a result of DNA damage. Cleavage of <br />                                             LexA depends on the activated form of the RecA protein, bound to single-stranded DNA. <br />  <br />                                             DNA gyrase cleavage complexes stabilized by nalidixic acid are necessary but not sufficient <br />                                             for induction of the SOS response. There is conflicting evidence as to whether DNA replication <br />                                             is required for induction of SOS by nalidixic acid (Gudas and Pardee, 1976; Sassanfar and <br />                                             Roberts, 1990). Aside from RecA, the only known protein that is required for SOS induction <br />                                             by nalidixic acid is the multifunctional RecBCD enzyme (for review, see Myers and Stahl, <br />                                             1994). Since RecBCD generally requires a DNA end to gain entry to DNA, its involvement in <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                    Gene.

Page 3 <br />  <br />  <br />                                             SOS induction suggests that a free DNA break is somehow generated from the nalidixic acid- <br />                                             stabilized cleavage complex. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             The above results provide strong parallels between the mechanism of cytotoxicity and the <br />                                             mechanism of SOS induction by nalidixic acid, particularly since recA, recB and recC mutants <br />                                             are all hypersensitive to the drug (McDaniel et al., 1978). It seems highly likely that whatever <br />                                             mechanism creates DNA breaks to induce the SOS pathway is also a mechanism that leads to <br />                                             cytotoxicity. In this report, we identify and analyze E. coli mutants with deficiencies in the <br />                                             SOS response to nalidixic acid. <br />  <br />                               2.

To search for genes that <br />                                             may be necessary for this step, we used the EZ::TN&#8482; &lt;KAN-2&gt; Tnp Transposome&#8482; Kit <br />                                             (Epicentre) to create a library of transposon mutants in the JH39 strain of E. coli.

The colonies were lifted onto nitrocellulose filters, which were then <br />                                             transferred to plates containing nalidixic acid and X-gal. After 4-hour and overnight incubation, <br />                                             a small fraction of the colonies displayed unusual color intensities, indicating different amounts <br />                                             of &#946;-galactosidase induction. We collected 25 &#8220;white mutants&#8221; with no apparent induction and <br />                                             105 &#8220;intermediate mutants&#8221; with reduced induction relative to JH39. We also isolated 66 &#8220;dark <br />                                             blue mutants&#8221; with increased induction relative to JH39; these are detailed elsewhere (O&apos;Reilly <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             and Kreuzer, 2004). <br />  <br />                               3.2. Secondary screens for induction with nalidixic acid or UV <br />                                             We began analyzing the white and intermediate mutants, which have apparent defects in SOS <br />                                             induction after nalidixic acid. As a secondary screen for SOS induction we performed a disk <br />                                             test in which a lawn of each mutant was exposed to three levels of nalidixic acid during growth <br />                                             on X-gal plates (Figure 1A). The zones of inhibition were also measured to allow for a <br />                                             determination of drug sensitivity (Table 1). All of the 25 white mutants showed normal-sized <br />                                             zones of inhibition and again displayed no blue color in the presence of the drug (e.g., compare <br />                                             W16 to wild-type JH39 in Figure 1A and Table 1). Sixty of the intermediate mutants looked <br />                                             indistinguishable from the parental JH39 in this test, both for nalidixic acid sensitivity and the <br />                                             intensity of &#946;-galactosidase induction. These were therefore judged to be false positives and <br />                                             were discarded. The remaining 45 intermediate mutants again showed reduced induction <br />                                             compared to JH39, with 20 displaying noticeably less color than the others. Each of these 20 <br />                                             mutants was also modestly hypersensitive to nalidixic acid, as exemplified by mutants I78 and <br />                                             I40 (Figure 1A and Table 1). Of the remaining 25 intermediate mutants, one (I28) appeared to <br />                                             be hypersensitive to nalidixic acid (Figure 1A and Table 1), while the other 24 were either <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             noticeably resistant or similar to the wild-type (Tables 1 and 2; also see Figure 1A, I104). <br />  <br />                                             As an additional secondary screen, all 25 white mutants and the remaining 45 intermediate <br />                                             mutants were tested for their SOS response to UV. Like nalidixic acid, UV treatment also <br />                                             induces the SOS response, but the pathway for induction requires recFOR rather than recBC, <br />                                             presumably because UV damage leads to single-stranded DNA rather than double-strand <br />                                             breaks (McPartland et al., 1980). Cells were spotted twice onto X-gal plates, and one of the <br />                                             spots was exposed to UV. In the wild-type control, strong induction was evident after four <br />                                             hours incubation (Figure 1B, JH39). <br />  <br />                                             All of the 25 white mutants were also uninducible in this UV test (e.g., Figure 1B, W16). <br />                                             Previous analysis of the JH39 genetic background has shown a background level of &#946;- <br />                                             galactosidase expression without any SOS-inducing agent, suggesting a low level of SOS- <br />                                             independent transcription of the dinD1::lacZ fusion (Heitman and Model, 1991; also see <br />  <br />  <br />                                                    Gene.

Twenty-nine of these <br />                                             showed apparently wild-type levels of SOS induction in response to UV (e.g., Figure 1B, I40), <br />                                             while the other 16 showed reduced induction (e.g., Figure 1B, I78, I104 and I28; Table 2). <br />                                             Mutants that are unable to process drug-stabilized cleavage complexes into an SOS signal <br />                                             should be among the 29 with a normal SOS response to UV. Those deficient in SOS response <br />                                             to both nalidixic acid and UV apparently have a more general defect in SOS induction. <br />  <br />                                             The small amount of &#946;-galactosidase expression shown by intermediate mutants in response <br />                                             to nalidixic acid might indicate that the mutated gene is not strictly required for the SOS <br />                                             response and/or that the dinD1::lacZ fusion is expressed at a low level without an SOS response <br />                                             (as mentioned above). <br />  <br />                               3.3. Analysis of insertions by DNA sequencing and P1 transduction <br />                                             We were most interested in the 29 intermediate mutants that showed normal UV responses, <br />                                             particularly those 18 that were hypersensitive to nalidixic acid. Nonetheless, to avoid missing <br />                                             any potentially interesting genes, we decided to sequence all of the intermediate mutants. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             We used the MasterPure&#8482; DNA Purification Kit (Epicentre) to purify genomic DNA from <br />                                             each mutant and then used the forward primer from the EZ::TN&#8482; transposon kit to sequence <br />                                             from one end of the transposon. Using a modified automatic sequencing protocol, we were <br />                                             able to obtain at least 100 bp of unambiguous sequence from each mutant. Using those <br />                                             sequences, the E. coli K12 genome was then searched using BLAST to determine which gene <br />                                             had been interrupted by the transposon (Table 2 and Table 3). <br />  <br />                                             Two of the insertion mutants were found to have the transposon within the trpB gene, which <br />                                             is part of the dinD1::lacZ fusion (Casadaban and Cohen, 1980). The SOS phenotypes caused <br />                                             by these insertions presumably result from polar effects on lacZ expression, and these two <br />                                             mutants were therefore discarded from the collection (not included in the Tables). <br />  <br />                                             Two of the transposon insertions from the intermediate class were in the recA gene. Both <br />                                             recA mutants were hypersensitive to nalidixic acid and were very light blue in both the nalidixic <br />                                             acid and UV tests. Given that JH39 produces a small amount of &#946;-galactosidase without <br />                                             exposure to a DNA-damaging agent (Heitman and Model, 1991), the very weak level of &#946;- <br />                                             galactosidase in the two recA insertion mutants is probably unrelated to the SOS pathway. We <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             found that a previously constructed recA56 derivative of JH39, called JH59 (Heitman and <br />                                             Model, 1991), also turned very light blue in a nalidixic acid disk test. Furthermore, Kenyon <br />                                             and Walker (1980) found that RecA was required for induced but not for basal expression from <br />                                             several din fusion constructs (the dinD1 fusion was not tested). In summary, the two new <br />                                             recA mutants had the expected phenotype: defective in the SOS response to both nalidixic acid <br />                                             and UV, and hypersensitive to nalidixic acid. <br />  <br />                                             We expected to find recB and recC mutants among the mutants that were specifically defective <br />                                             in the SOS response to nalidixic acid (see Introduction). Indeed, sequencing revealed eight <br />                                             insertions in recB and eight in recC, and all 16 were hypersensitive to nalidixic acid (see Tables <br />                                             1 and 2). Finding recB and recC mutants in this group validated our mutant hunt, and also <br />                                             focused our attention on other mutants with the same phenotype in our search for additional <br />                                             genes necessary for the SOS response from nalidixic acid-stabilized cleavage complexes. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                    Gene.

Page 6 <br />  <br />  <br />                                             Besides the 16 recBC mutants, the only other intermediate mutants that fit this category of <br />                                             interest had an insertion in ompA, the gene for a major outer membrane protein, or yhcL, the <br />                                             product of which has been suggested to be involved in dicarboxylate transport (Janausch and <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             Unden, 1999). Because neither protein function suggested a role in the processing of cleavage <br />                                             complexes and because each gene was found only once in the screen, we were suspicious that <br />                                             the transposon insertions in these two strains might not be causing the observed phenotype. To <br />                                             resolve this uncertainty, we performed phage P1 transductions to move each transposon <br />                                             insertion mutation into a clean JH39 background, using the kanamycin selectable marker. The <br />                                             transductants behaved like wild-type JH39 in both the nalidixic acid and UV tests, indicating <br />                                             that the transposon mutations in ompA and yhcL were not causing the interesting phenotype. <br />                                             Because we had screened about 19,000 colonies for the phenotype of interest, it seemed quite <br />                                             possible that these two had acquired a spontaneous mutation that inactivated either recB or <br />                                             recC. Indeed, PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the ompA and yhcL strains revealed <br />                                             that their recB genes were approximately 1000 bp longer than the wild-type recB gene from <br />                                             JH39. It seems very likely that an endogenous insertion sequence had interrupted the recB <br />                                             genes in both strains, giving them the recBC-like phenotype. The ompA and yhcL insertions <br />                                             were therefore discarded from the collection and are not included in the Tables. <br />  <br />                                             These results with the ompA and yhcL insertions raised the concern that other transposon <br />                                             insertions in our collection might not be causing the phenotype of interest. Insertions in 10 <br />                                             different genes, including recA, recB and recC, were isolated multiple times with the same <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             phenotype, arguing very strongly that the transposon is causative in those cases. However, in <br />                                             addition to ompA and yhcL, we isolated single-hit insertions in 6 additional genes/reading <br />                                             frames. To test whether these insertions were causing the SOS phenotype, we again performed <br />                                             P1 transductions using the insertion mutants as donors and JH39 as recipient. Kanamycin- <br />                                             resistant transductants from the hns, intQ, moaD and mobA donors recapitulated the SOS <br />                                             phenotypes of their donor parents, confirming that the transposon was causative in each case. <br />                                             Two other insertion mutants failed this transduction test and were therefore eliminated from <br />                                             the collection (not included in Tables). <br />  <br />                               4. Discussion <br />                                             We are interested in the pathway(s) that leads to DNA breaks after treatment with inhibitors <br />                                             that stabilize topoisomerase cleavage complexes. Such DNA breaks are thought to be involved <br />                                             in cytotoxicity and DNA rearrangements caused by inhibitors of type II topoisomerases (see <br />                                             Introduction). Elucidation of the detailed mechanism of DNA break formation may reveal <br />                                             important aspects of replication fork dynamics, and might also have implications for <br />                                             antibacterial and anticancer chemotherapy with topoisomerase inhibitors. We approached this <br />                                             issue experimentally by taking advantage of the SOS response, isolating mutants with reduced <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             SOS induction upon nalidixic acid treatment. <br />  <br />                                             Mutational inactivation of recB or recC blocks SOS induction by nalidixic acid but not by UV <br />                                             (McPartland et al., 1980), so we focused our attention on mutants with this phenotype. Out of <br />                                             19,000 transposon insertion mutants, we found 18 that were defective for induction by nalidixic <br />                                             acid but normal for induction by UV. Sixteen of these had a transposon insertion in the recB <br />                                             or recC gene, which confirms the validity of the genetic screen. Another two had insertions <br />                                             elsewhere, but we found that these two strains had an approximately 1-kb insertion in the <br />                                             recB gene, which explains the induction defect. E. coli has numerous <span id='am-1' about='obo:NCBITaxon_2673' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_28384'><span id='am-2' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:11" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-3' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Insertion" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-4' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-5' property="rdfs:label" content="insertion sequences" datatype="xsd:string"></span>insertion sequences</span> that <br />                                             are roughly 1-kb in size (Galas and Chandler, 1989), so we surmise that these mutants had <br />                                             undergone a transposition event that inactivated the recB gene at some time prior to our genetic <br />                                             screen. Since the competent cells for generating the 19,000 transposon insertion mutants were <br />                                             grown as a single batch, these two strains may have started out as siblings with the insertion <br />                                             sequence in recB prior to the transformation of the transposon. <br />  <br />  <br />                                                    Gene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2008 January 15. <br />                             Newmark et al.                                                                                               Page 7 <br />  <br />  <br />                                             Thus, we found a total of 18 mutants with the desired phenotype, but all 18 were defective in <br />                                             recB or recC. Since we screened 19,000 colonies and isolated so many recBC mutants, the <br />                                             screen was quite thorough, and it is unlikely that any novel gene would be uncovered by <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             screening additional mutants using this method and these criteria. Because this was a <br />                                             transposon mutagenesis strategy, one possibility is that RecBCD is the only non-essential <br />                                             protein involved in SOS induction by nalidixic acid but not by UV. Only the helicase activity <br />                                             of RecBCD is necessary for SOS induction after nalidixic acid treatment (Chaudhury and <br />                                             Smith, 1985). Therefore, the role of RecBCD is probably limited to generation of single- <br />                                             stranded DNA from the break, and the enzyme is not likely involved in break formation. <br />  <br />                                             These results are consistent with the possibility that essential cellular proteins are involved in <br />                                             DNA break formation from the cleavage complex. For example, transcription and/or DNA <br />                                             replication could be necessary. One specific model is the replication fork run-off model, in <br />                                             which the replisome directly causes DNA breaks upon collision with the cleavage complex <br />                                             (see Introduction). If transcription and/or replication are necessary for break formation, then <br />                                             some of our mutants might have reduced SOS induction simply because of slower growth. We <br />                                             measured the growth rate of one insertion mutant for each of the genes uncovered here, and <br />                                             found that several did indeed have significantly decreased growth rates: cyaA, icdA, mcrA/ <br />                                             elbA, crp, and tufA (<span id='am-50' about='obo:NCBITaxon_1369087' typeof='obo:NCBITaxon_37567 owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_33340 obo:NCBITaxon_33213 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_85604 obo:NCBITaxon_104431 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_37570 obo:NCBITaxon_41191 obo:NCBITaxon_33317 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_6072 obo:NCBITaxon_6960 obo:NCBITaxon_33208 obo:NCBITaxon_41196 obo:NCBITaxon_197562 obo:NCBITaxon_85512 obo:NCBITaxon_197563 obo:NCBITaxon_95182 obo:NCBITaxon_41197 obo:NCBITaxon_6656 obo:NCBITaxon_7496 obo:NCBITaxon_7088 obo:NCBITaxon_1206794 obo:NCBITaxon_88770 obo:NCBITaxon_7100 obo:NCBITaxon_33392 obo:NCBITaxon_50557'><span id='am-51' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-52' property="rdfs:label" content="Data" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-53' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-54'  ></span>data</span> not shown; we did not test tufB, but it would presumably grow similarly <br />                                             to the tufA mutant). While any of these mutants could have reduced SOS induction due to poor <br />                                             growth, we note that the other mutants we isolated had little or no growth defect, and we would <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             have expected to isolate many other poor-growth mutants if that was all that was necessary to <br />                                             reduce SOS induction. <br />  <br />                                             A second possible explanation for finding only recBC mutants with the desired phenotype is <br />                                             that multiple pathways process the cleavage complex into an SOS-inducing signal. Some <br />                                             candidates for genes that might be involved in redundant pathways were uncovered in mutants <br />                                             that were modestly defective for SOS induction after nalidixic acid but seemingly normal after <br />                                             UV, namely icdA, intQ, mcrA/elbA, moaD, mobA, tufA/B and trkH (Table 2). The only mutants <br />                                             in this group with altered sensitivity to nalidixic acid were those in trkH, which were modestly <br />                                             resistant to the drug (Table 1). The trkH gene encodes an integral membrane protein involved <br />                                             in potassium uptake (Silver, 1996) and trkH mutations might somehow impact nalidixic acid <br />                                             uptake or efflux. Thus, the decreased SOS response of trkH mutants could simply reflect a <br />                                             lower effective level of inhibitor inside the cell. None of the other genes mentioned above has <br />                                             a function that clearly suggests an involvement in cleavage complex processing. However, two <br />                                             of the gene products have known or suspected DNA cleavage activities: McrA, which is a <br />                                             restriction endonuclease, and IntQ, which is encoded by a cryptic prophage and is related to <br />                                             the integrase <span id='am-6' about='obo:NCBITaxon_family' typeof='owl:Thing NCBITaxon:_taxonomic_rank'><span id='am-7' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-8' property="rdfs:label" content="family" datatype="xsd:string"></span>family</span> of proteins. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             An inherent limitation of our genetic screen raises a third possible explanation for finding only <br />                                             recBC mutants with a strong SOS defect that is specific for nalidixic acid treatment. Perhaps <br />                                             the mutants of interest were missed in our screen because they were partially constitutive for <br />                                             the SOS response. That is, even in the absence of nalidixic acid, the desired mutants might <br />                                             have levels of &#946;-galactosidase similar to or greater than the levels in wild-type cells with <br />                                             nalidixic acid. Insertions in a variety of important DNA metabolism genes cause an SOS <br />                                             constitutive phenotype (O&#8217;Reilly and Kreuzer, 2004), and we are currently analyzing these to <br />                                             see if any are defective for SOS induction after nalidixic acid treatment. <br />  <br />                                             Our collection also included insertions in four genes that caused SOS defects after either <br />                                             nalidixic acid or UV treatment. Mutations in each of these genes are known to cause pleiotropic <br />                                             effects by altering nucleiod structure and gene expression (hns), protease function (clpP) or <br />                                             the cyclic AMP regulatory system (cyaA and crp) (Dorman, 2004; Saier et al., 1996; Gross, <br />                                             1996).
