In contrast to C. <br />           albicans, in which the roles of calcineurin and Crz1 in hyphal growth are unclear, here we show that <br />           calcineurin and Crz1 play a clearly demonstrable role in hyphal growth in response to nutrient limitation <br />           in C. dubliniensis. We further demonstrate that thigmotropism is controlled by Crz1, but not calcineurin, <br />           in C. dubliniensis. Similar to C. albicans, C. dubliniensis calcineurin enhances survival in serum. C. <br />           dubliniensis calcineurin and crz1/crz1 mutants exhibit attenuated virulence in a murine systemic infection <br />           model, likely attributable to defects in cell wall integrity, hyphal growth, and serum survival. Furthermore, <br />           we show that C. dubliniensis calcineurin mutants are unable to establish murine ocular infection or form <br />           biofilms in a rat denture model. That calcineurin is required for drug tolerance and virulence makes <br />           fungus-specific calcineurin inhibitors attractive candidates for combination therapy with azoles or echi- <br />           nocandins against emerging C. dubliniensis infections. <br />  <br />  <br />    Although Candida albicans is the most prevalent species                    with HIV/AIDS (6, 82).
