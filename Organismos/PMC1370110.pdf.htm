The RNA <br /> subunits of each enzyme share substantial secondary structural features, and most of the protein subunits are shared <br /> between the two. One of the conserved RNA subdomains, designated P3, has previously been shown to be required <br /> for nucleolar localization. Phylogenetic sequence analysis suggests that the P3 domain interacts with one of the <br /> proteins common to RNase P and RNase MRP, a conclusion strengthened by an earlier observation that the essential <br /> domain can be interchanged between the two enzymes. To examine possible functions of the P3 domain, four <br /> conserved nucleotides in the P3 domain of <span id='am-1' about='obo:NCBITaxon_4932' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_4930 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_4751 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_4893 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_451864 obo:NCBITaxon_4892 obo:NCBITaxon_4891 obo:NCBITaxon_4890 obo:NCBITaxon_716545 obo:NCBITaxon_147537 obo:NCBITaxon_2759'><span id='am-2' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Candida robusta" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-3'  ></span><span id='am-4' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccharomyces italicus" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-5' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="baker&apos;s yeast" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-6' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccharomyces uvarum var. melibiosus" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-7' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccaromyces cerevisiae" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-8' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-9' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccharomyces capensis" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-10' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="yeast" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-11' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccharomyes cerevisiae" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-12' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="lager beer yeast" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-13' property="rdfs:label" content="Saccharomyces cerevisiae" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-14' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccharomyces oviformis" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-15' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="brewer&apos;s yeast" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-16' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Sccharomyces cerevisiae" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-17' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> RNase P RNA (RPR1 ) were randomized to <br /> create a library of all possible sequence combinations at those positions.
