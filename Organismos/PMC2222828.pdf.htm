TIR is translocated via a type-III secretion system into the intestinal epithelial cell membrane, <br /> where it serves as an anchor for E. coli attachment via its binding partner intimin. While many aspects of <br /> EPEC and EHEC infection are now well understood, the importance of the intermolecular contacts made <br /> between intimin and TIR have not been thoroughly investigated. Herein we report site-directed <br /> mutagenesis studies on the intimin-binding domain of EPEC TIR, and how these mutations affect TIR- <br /> intimin association, as analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry and circular dichroism. These results <br /> show how two factors govern TIR&#8217;s binding to intimin: A three-residue TIR hot spot is identified that <br /> largely mediates the interaction, and mutants that alter the b-hairpin structure of TIR severely diminish <br /> binding affinity. In addition, peptides incorporating key TIR residues identified by mutagenesis are <br /> incapable of binding intimin. These results indicate that hot spot residues and structural orientation/ <br /> preorganization are required for EPEC, and likely EHEC, TIR-intimin binding. <br /> Keywords: EPEC; EHEC; intimin; translocated intimin receptor (TIR) <br /> Supplemental material: see www.proteinscience.org <br />  <br />  <br /> Intimin and the translocated intimin receptor (TIR) of                         Knutton et al. 1997).
