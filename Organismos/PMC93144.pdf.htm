The <br />           impossibility of obtaining an accB null mutant and the thiostrepton growth dependency of a tipAp accB <br />           conditional mutant confirmed that AccB is essential for S. coelicolor viability. Normal growth phenotype in the <br />           absence of the inducer was restored in the conditional mutant by the addition of exogenous long-chain fatty <br />           acids in the medium, indicating that the inducer-dependent phenotype was specifically related to a conditional <br />           block in fatty acid biosynthesis. Thus, AccB, together with AccA2, which is also an essential protein (E. <br />           Rodriguez and H. Gramajo, Microbiology 143:3109&#8211;3119, 1999), are the most likely components of an ACCase <br />           whose main physiological role is the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis. <br />           Although normal growth of the conditional mutant was restored by fatty acids, the cultures did not produce <br />           actinorhodin or undecylprodigiosin, suggesting a direct participation of this enzyme complex in the supply of <br />           malonyl-CoA for the synthesis of these secondary metabolites. <br />  <br />  <br />    Malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential metabolite in                       Several complexes with acyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) ac- <br /> most living organisms.

If this hypothesis was correct accB       and mutants in this subunit only affected the intracellular levels <br /> mutants would not be able to sporulate, even in the presence of       of acetyl-CoA carboxylase but not of the PCCase activity, <br /> oleate, and would be lost in the isolation procedure utilized.        showing a sharp difference with our findings. <br />    Considering the essential role played by AccB and taking <br /> into account the apparent inviability of accA2 mutants in                                        <br /> S. coelicolor (36), we postulate that AccA2 and AccB are the &#9251; <br />                                                                        . <br /> and &#9252; components of an ACCase, whose main physiological        <br /> role is the synthesis of malonyl-CoA. Transcriptional studies of      <br /> accBE and accA2 showed that the expression of these genes             <br /> occurred principally during the exponential and transition  <br /> phases of growth (Fig. 5A and 6A), in agreement with their   <br /> essential role in this organism. Consistent with these results the <br /> levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and PCCase activity through- <br /> out growth were also found to be maximal during exponential                                             <br /> phase (data not shown).                 <br />    In S. coelicolor, in addition to the need for malonyl-CoA  <br /> synthesis during vegetative growth, there is also a requirement   <br /> for this metabolite during transition and stationary phase. At  <br /> least two of the secondary metabolites produced by S. coeli-    <br /> color, undecylprodigiosin and actinorhodin, are synthesized       <br /> during these growth phases and require malonyl-CoA for their  <br /> synthesis. If the essential ACCase characterized in this work is      <br /> the only enzyme capable of synthesizing malonyl-CoA, then it        <br /> will also be required during the production of these two anti-   <br /> biotics. In agreement with this hypothesis fatty acid-supple-       <br /> mented cultures of the M94 conditional mutant, for which             <br /> ACCase activity was barely detectable, were unable to produce   <br /> actinorhodin or undecylprodigiosin. Based on the proposed        <br /> composition of the enzyme complex and on the transcriptional  <br /> studies reported here, we suggest that the low level of expres-          <br /> sion of accA2 and accBE that occurs during stationary phase       <br /> provides enough of the &#9251; and &#9252; components to produce suffi-  <br /> cient ACCase for secondary metabolism. If this assumption is   <br /> correct, the biosynthesis of polyketide antibiotics in S. coeli-    <br /> color should be improved by overproduction of the ACCase   <br /> components during stationary phase.                    <br />    While the burst of accA1 transcription during transition       <br /> phase could provide a new biotinylated component for the                <br /> ACCase complex during stationary phase, mutation of accA1                <br /> did not change the level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase or PCCase   <br /> throughout growth. Moreover, this mutation has no deleteri-        <br /> ous effect on antibiotic production in S. coelicolor (36); conse-       <br /> quently, the physiological role of AccA1 remains uncertain     <br /> (although its location in cosmid AH10 [35] adjacent to a new      <br /> putative PKS cluster might suggest a role in the synthesis of    <br /> a hitherto unknown polyketide). For instance, a gene, jadJ,            <br /> whose deduced amino acid sequence showed a high degree of                 <br /> similarity with that of AccA1 (70% identity) has been recently    <br /> located in the gene cluster associated with jadomycin B bio-          <br /> synthesis in <span id='am-108' about='obo:NCBITaxon_54571' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_1760 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_2 obo:NCBITaxon_2037 obo:NCBITaxon_2062 obo:NCBITaxon_201174 obo:NCBITaxon_1883 obo:NCBITaxon_85003 obo:NCBITaxon_85011'><span id='am-109' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="PMID:8897428" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-110' property="rdfs:label" content="Streptomyces venezuelae" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-111' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:11" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-112' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-113'  ></span><span id='am-114' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="Streptomyces venezuelensis" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Streptomyces venezuelae</span> (14).
