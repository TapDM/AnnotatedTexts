Consequently, the func- <br /> tion of many essential genes in these and subsequent stages, <br /> including those encoding vaccine candidates, cannot be addressed <br /> genetically. Here, we establish conditional mutagenesis in Plasmo- <br /> dium by using site-specific recombination and the Flp&#20862;FRT system <br /> of yeast. Site-specific recombination is induced after cross-fertili- <br /> zation in the mosquito vector of two clones containing either the <br /> target sequence flanked by two FRT sites or the Flp recombinase. <br /> Parasites that have undergone recombination are recognized in the <br /> cross progeny through the expression of a fluorescence marker. <br /> This approach should permit to dissect the function of any essential <br /> gene of Plasmodium during the haploid phase of its life, i.e., during <br /> infection of salivary glands in the mosquito and infection of both <br /> the liver and red blood cells in the mammal. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> A     ll symptoms and complications of malaria are caused by the <br />       multiplication of Plasmodium parasites inside the red blood <br /> cells (RBC) of a host. The parasite is transmitted between two <br /> mammalian hosts through mosquitoes, typically Anopheles, dur- <br /> ing blood feeding (Fig. 1). It is ingested as sexual forms (game-                Fig. 1. Strategy for conditional mutagenesis in Plasmodium.
