Human cells have five Sgs1 homologues with <br />                                  unknown selectivity and significance for repair of different DSB types. Here we examined the <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                  importance of WRN helicase in repair of G2-specific DSB caused by abnormal mismatch repair <br />                                  (MMR) of ternary Cr-DNA adducts. We found that Cr(VI) induced a rapid dispersal of WRN from <br />                                  the nucleolus resulting in its prolonged retention in the nucleoplasm. The loss of MSH2 or MLH1 <br />                                  MMR proteins abolished the long-term but not the initial WRN relocalization. WRN-deficient <br />                                  fibroblasts were hypersensitive to Cr(VI)-induced clonogenic death and contained high levels of <br />                                  persistent DSB detected by &#947;-H2AX/53BP1 foci and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. WRN was <br />                                  involved in recombination repair of Cr-induced DNA damage, as evidenced by WRN-RAD51 <br />                                  colocalization and defective formation of RAD51 foci in the absence of WRN. The accumulation <br />                                  of unrepaired DSB in WRN-depleted cells was rescued by the inactivation of MMR, indicating <br />                                  that MMR-generated DSB were a key substrate for WRN action in Cr(VI)-treated cells. <br />                                  Competition for the limited amounts of WRN in primary cells between G2 processes of telomere <br />                                  rebuilding and recombinational repair is expected to increase persistence of Cr-induced DSB and <br />                                  may cause telomeric abnormalities in tissues of chronically chromate-exposed workers.

Recent studies have found that the yeast RecQ helicase Sgs1 stimulated <br />                                             recombination repair of DSB through its essential function in one of the two redundant DNA <br />                                             ends resection pathways.20,21 The RecQ helicase BLM appears to play a role analogous to <br />                                             that of Sgs1 in campthothecin-treated human cells where it acts in parallel with EXO1 to <br />                                             promote recombination-associated foci and cell survival.22 The presence of five RecQ <br />                                             members in human cells potentially indicates that individual helicases may participate in <br />                                             repair of different classes of DSB. It is currently unknown whether repair of specific DSB in <br />                                             human cells is particularly dependent on WRN or even involves this helicase. <br />  <br />                                             In this work, we investigated the importance of WRN in cellular survival and repair of DSB <br />                                             induced by the potent human carcinogen chromium(VI). The main source of DSB in Cr(VI)- <br />                                             treated human cells is misprocessing of Cr-DNA damage by mismatch repair (MMR).23&#8211;25 <br />                                             The majority of Cr-induced DSB are formed in G2 phase following replication of Cr- <br />                                             adducted DNA.23,24 Ternary Cr-DNA adducts, such as cysteine-Cr-DNA or ascorbate-Cr- <br />                                             DNA crosslinks, were particularly good substrates for recognition by MMR proteins.24,25 <br />                                             These adducts were also a primary cause of the mutagenic responses generated in shuttle- <br />                                             vector <span id='am-61' about='obo:NCBITaxon_36549' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_28384'><span id='am-62' property="oboInOwl:hasAlternativeId" content="NCBITaxon:2435" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-63' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:11" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-64' property="rdfs:label" content="plasmids" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-65' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span>plasmids</span> damaged during Cr(VI) reduction in vitro with ascorbate26,27 or cysteine.28 <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             Chronic formation of toxic DSB by MMR activity during repetitive exposures to Cr(VI) has <br />                                             been proposed to promote the selection of transformation-prone, Cr-resistant cells lacking <br />                                             MMR, providing an explanation for the unusually high frequency of microsatellite <br />                                             instability (marker of inactive MMR) in lung cancers among chromate workers.29 Unlike <br />                                             other agents with MMR-dependent mechanisms of cytotoxicity,30&#8211;32 the formation of DSB <br />                                             in Cr-exposed cells is unusually rapid which results from the unprecedented activation of <br />                                             both the MSH6 and MSH3 branches of MMR.25 MSH3 specifically recognizes and repairs <br />                                             mismatches containing insertion/deletion loops,33,34 pointing to a potential formation of <br />                                             these structures in Cr-damaged DNA.

Therefore, <br />                                             it is possible that repair of MMR-generated DSB in Cr-damaged DNA may engage WRN. <br />                                             Cr-induced DSB are also well suited for testing the involvement of WRN in homologous <br />                                             recombination because it is a principal DSB repair process in S/G2 cells and the main target <br />                                             for the activity of RecQ helicases in lower organisms.20,21 <br />  <br />                               Materials and Methods <br />                               Cell cultures and drug treatments <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             Human SV40 transformed fibroblast lines GM00637H (NF cells) and GM00847 (LNS cells) <br />                                             were purchased from Coriell Cell Repository.

Therefore, we chose to perform our investigation in <br />                                             telomerase-negative human cells. A potential role of WRN helicase in cellular responses to <br />                                             Cr-DNA damage was first examined by clonogenic survival of Cr-treated WRN-expressing <br />                                             NF and WRN-null WS fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). WS cells displayed high sensitivity to <br />                                             clonogenic lethality by Cr(VI) with only a few colonies surviving at 10 &#956;M Cr while <br />                                             approximately 50% NF cells were clonogenically viable at this dose. Since NF and WS cells <br />                                             are not isogenic, we created a stable knockdown of WRN protein in NF cells by expressing a <br />                                             targeting shRNA from a chromosomally integrated pSUPER-RETRO vector (Fig. 1B, top <br />                                             panel).

Although LNS cells were more resistant <br />                                             to Cr(VI) relative to NF cells, WRN knockdown in these cells resulted in essentially the <br />                                             same degree of sensitization to Cr(VI) toxicity (Fig. 1D). <br />  <br />                               Altered intranuclear localization of WRN after Cr(VI) damage <br />                                             WRN is typically found in the nucleolus of primary and transformed human cells.5 <br />                                             Costaining for WRN and the nucleolar marker B23 showed that the majority of NF cells also <br />                                             exhibited nucleolar localization of WRN (Fig. 2A). In response to Cr(VI) exposure, WRN <br />                                             relocalized from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm. The nucleoplasmic localization was <br />                                             observed immediately after 3 hr-long exposures to 10&#8211;20 &#956;M Cr(VI) and it was retained in <br />                                             treated cells up to 24 hr post-treatment.

To test this possibility, we examined the effects <br />                                             of WRN deficiency on the persistence of DSB after Cr(VI) removal. The presence of DSB <br />                                             was detected by the appearance of 53BP1 and &#947;&#8211;H2AX foci and only cells exhibiting focal <br />                                             staining for both proteins were scored as DSB-positive (Fig. 3A). 53BP1 is recruited <br />                                             following remodeling of chromatin regions flanking the break44 and serves as a second <br />                                             marker of DSB. Levels of DSB induced by moderate doses of Cr(VI) typically approached <br />                                             their peak at about 6 hr post-exposure.23,24 Treatment of NF and LNS cells with moderately <br />                                             toxic Cr(VI) doses (~60% clonogenic survival) also resulted in a strong production of DSB <br />                                             foci at 6 hr post-Cr and WRN depletion had no significant effect on this initial induction of <br />                                             DSB (Fig. 3B,C). However, at 24 hr post-exposure, there were approximately twice as many <br />                                             DSB foci-positive cells with WRN knockdown as compared to their shGFP controls.

As in primary cells,24 increasing <br />                                             cellular ascorbate levels enhanced DSB-producing activity of Cr(VI), and WRN depletion <br />                                             resulted in the presence of persistent DSB even after exposure to as low as 2 &#956;M Cr(VI), <br />                                             which is the current EPA standard for chromium in drinking water.47 Analysis of <br />                                             chromosomal DNA by PFGE further confirmed the importance of WRN in repair of Cr- <br />                                             induced DSB as evidenced by 2.7-times (p&lt;0.01) higher levels of remaining DNA breaks in <br />                                             WRN-depleted LNS cells at 24 hr after Cr(VI) exposure (Fig. 3F). Control LNS cells with <br />                                             normal WRN levels were also capable of repairing the majority of DSB generated even by <br />                                             50 &#956;M Cr(VI) while WRN-depleted cells were unable to show significant repair of much <br />                                             fewer DSB induced by 30 &#956;M Cr(VI) (Fig. 3G). <br />  <br />                               Attenuated formation of RAD51 foci in WRN-deficient cells <br />                                             The majority of Cr-induced DSB are present in G2 cells.23,24 Since DSB repair in G2 cells <br />                                             occurs primarily via homologous recombination,48,49 we examined the effect of WRN on <br />                                             this repair process. The activity of recombination repair was assessed by scoring foci of <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             RAD51, which is one of the essential recombination repair proteinsand a specific marker of <br />                                             recombination repair sites.50 Treatment of NF cells with either moderate 10 &#956;M or highly <br />                                             toxic 20 &#956;M doses of Cr(VI) did not increase the production of RAD51 foci above <br />                                             background levels at 6 hr post-exposure (Fig. 4A,B). At 24 hr post-Cr, NF cells with <br />                                             nonspecific GFP-shRNA displayed a significant induction of RAD51 foci at both Cr(VI) <br />                                             doses while WRN-depleted cells showed no change relative to untreated controls. Thus, <br />                                             activation of recombination repair in NF cells significantly lagged the induction of DSB in <br />                                             the presence of WRN (Fig. 3B,C) or was absent in cells with WRN knockdown. To further <br />                                             confirm these findings, we investigated the formation of RAD51 foci in LNS cells (Fig. 4C). <br />                                             Control LNS cells showed a strong induction of RAD51 foci already at 6 hr post-Cr but <br />                                             WRN depletion completely abrogated recombination foci at this time. At 24 hr post-Cr, <br />                                             WRN-depleted LNS cells displayed a significant increase in the number of RAD51 foci, <br />                                             which was still modestly lower than in control cells. Thus, both cell lines showed a strong <br />                                             positive effect of WRN on the formation of RAD51 foci.

We also analyzed RAD51 foci in WRN-null WS <br />                                             cells treated with 10 and 20 &#956;M Cr(VI), doses that were clearly genotoxic to these cells (Fig. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             1A). Neither Cr(VI) dose caused even a marginal increase in the induction of RAD51 foci at <br />                                             24 hr post-exposure (Fig. 4D), further confirming the importance of WRN protein for the <br />                                             initiation of recombination repair of Cr-DNA damage. A large fraction of Cr-induced <br />                                             RAD51 focus-positive NF and LNS cells also showed a partial colocalization (ranging from <br />                                             20 to 80%) of RAD51 foci with WRN (Fig. 4E,F). <br />  <br />                               Mismatch repair (MMR)-mediated DNA lesions and WRN <br />                                             The main cause of DSB in human cells treated with low to moderately toxic doses of Cr(VI) <br />                                             is abnormal processing of Cr-DNA crosslinks by MMR.23&#8211;25 We have also observed that <br />                                             ascorbate, which enhances DSB production by aberrant MMR activity,24 increased the <br />                                             levels of DNA breaks in WRN-depleted cells at Cr(VI) concentrations that were otherwise <br />                                             nongenotoxic (Fig. 3D,E). Therefore, we tested whether WRN was responding to secondary <br />                                             DNA lesions generated by MMR. We first examined the dynamics of WRN localization in <br />                                             Cr(VI)-treated human HCT116 cells lacking or expressing MLH1, which is one of the <br />                                             essential MMR proteins.33,34 The majority of control cells in both lines showed costaining <br />                                             of WRN with the nucleolar marker B23, demonstrating that MLH1 has no effect on the <br />                                             retention of WRN in nucleoli of unstressed cells (Fig. 5A). Immediately after Cr(VI) <br />                                             exposure, WRN dispersed from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm in the majority of cells <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             irrespective of their MLH1 status. Similarly to NF cells (Fig. 2), MLH1+ HCT116 cells also <br />                                             retained nucleoplasmic WRN at 24 hr post-Cr. In contrast, MLH1&#8722;/&#8722; HCT116 cells restored <br />                                             the normal nucleolar localization of WRN at 3&#8211;6 hr post-exposure. To further investigate the <br />                                             MMR-dependence of WRN dynamics, we created stable knockdowns of MLH1 or MSH2 <br />                                             MMR proteins in primary human IMR90 fibroblasts (Fig. 5B). We found that WRN <br />                                             relocalized in all IMR90 constructs immediately after Cr(VI) exposure but while control <br />                                             Luc-shRNA cells retained WRN in the nucleoplasm, cells with MLH1 or MSH2 <br />                                             knockdowns restored nucleolar WRN staining already at 3 hr post-Cr (Fig. 5C). Thus, the <br />                                             initial relocalization of WRN occurred directly in response to Cr(VI)-induced stress but the <br />                                             long-term retention in the nucleoplasm required the presence of MMR proteins. The <br />                                             nucleoplasmic retention of WRN was not due to binding to MMR proteins, as co- <br />                                             immunoprecipitation experiments found no detectable association of WRN with MSH6 or <br />                                             MSH2 in control or Cr(VI)-treated NF cells (Fig. 5D). MSH6 immunoprecipitates contained <br />                                             large amounts of its binding partner MSH2,33,34 validating the effectiveness of the <br />                                             employed procedure. Sensitization of WRN-depleted cells to Cr(VI) toxicity did not appear <br />                                             to result from the alterations in the MMR system as expression of three major MMR <br />                                             proteins MSH6, MSH2 and MLH1 did not vary between GFP-shRNA and WRN-shRNA <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             cells (Fig. 5E). Cr(VI) exposure also had no significant effect on the protein levels of WRN <br />                                             itself (Fig. 5E). <br />  <br />                                             The observed MMR-dependent dynamics of WRN in the absence of direct interactions with <br />                                             MMR proteins suggested that WRN could be responding to MMR-induced DSB. To test this <br />                                             possibility, we constructed NF cells with double knockdowns of MSH6 and WRN (Fig. 6A). <br />                                             We found that depending on Cr(VI) dose, knockdown of MSH6 in WRN-depleted cells <br />                                             either completely abrogated or significantly suppressed the levels of persistent DSB foci <br />                                             (Fig. 6B). The presence of ascorbate strongly potentiated the formation of DSB by Cr(VI) <br />                                             (Fig. 3E) and at low doses essentially all ascorbate-promoted DSB are MMR-generated.24 <br />                                             We found that depletion of MSH6 completely eliminated the presence of persistent DSB in <br />                                             Cr-treated/ascorbate-preloaded cells with WRN knockdown (Fig. 6C). This effect was quite <br />                                             striking, as even cells with normal WRN levels (GFP/GFP controls) were unable to fully <br />                                             repair DSB.

The loss of <br />                                             WRN resulted in increased clonogenic toxicity of Cr(VI), demonstrating the importance of <br />                                             this RecQ-type helicase in cell survival. Cellular reduction of Cr(VI) generates a transient <br />                                             oxidative stress due to the formation of redox-active CrV/IV intermediates51,52 and yields <br />                                             stable Cr-DNA adducts.45 The prolonged nucleoplasmic retention of WRN in Cr-treated <br />                                             cells, but not its initial relocalization, was dependent on the presence of intact MMR. Thus, <br />                                             the early WRN movement was likely caused by the cellular stress during Cr(VI) metabolism <br />                                             but its subsequent nucleoplasmic presence reflected other events involving MMR. <br />                                             Processing of Cr-DNA adducts by human MMR generates DSB as secondary, more toxic <br />                                             DNA lesions.23&#8211;25 We found that WRN played a major role in repair of MMR-induced DSB <br />                                             in Cr(VI)-treated human fibroblasts without significant effects on the initial production of <br />                                             DNA breaks. The presence of unrepaired DSB was likely responsible for the decreased <br />                                             survival of WRN-depleted cells in the clonogenic assay. Poor repair of DSB in WRN- <br />                                             lacking cells was associated with their deficiency in activation of early steps in homologous <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             recombination, as revealed by the absence or severely delayed formation of RAD51 foci <br />                                             after Cr-DNA damage. Functional recombination repair is known to play an important role <br />                                             in cellular resistance to Cr(VI) toxicity.53,54 <br />  <br />                                             Induction of DSB by MMR typically begins within 1&#8211;3 hr post-Cr exposure and occurs in <br />                                             G2 cells following their replication of Cr-adducted DNA.23,24 The late steps in MMR- <br />                                             dependent processing of Cr-DNA damage prior to DNA breakage are dependent on the <br />                                             activity of MSH3-MSH2 heterodimer (MutS&#946; complex).25 MutS&#946; dimer exhibits high <br />                                             specificity for DNA loops of various sizes,33,34 suggesting that MMR-induced DSB could <br />                                             be associated with the presence of loops or hairpins. While the presence of loops or hairpins <br />                                             can interfere with the activity of many DNA-processing enzymes, DNA ends with adjacent <br />                                             loops are high affinity substrates for WRN.2 Additionally, a strong requirement of WRN for <br />                                             the initiation of RAD51-dependent recombination in Cr-treated cells could have also <br />                                             reflected a limited availability of EXO1 that operates in a parallel pathway leading to the <br />                                             activation of recombination repair of DSB.20&#8211;22 The role of the RecQ helicases in DSB <br />                                             processing was most evident when cells were made deficient in EXO1/Exo1.

Persistent DSB can cause a variety of gross genetic rearrangements, including <br />                                              chromosomal deletions and translocations,57,58 that are likely contributing to the high <br />                                              carcinogenicity of even moderate chromate exposures found in the modern workplace <br />                                              environment.47,59 Consequently, individuals with low WRN levels could be at a greater risk <br />                                              for Cr(VI)-associated genotoxicity and carcinogenesis.
