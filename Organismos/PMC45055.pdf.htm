Accumulation of cytoplasmic structures in cells expressing dominant lethal pmal- mutations. Cells carrying either pXZ03 (PMAJ), <br /> pXZO9 (pmal-D378N), or pSN122 (pmal-A135W) were induced with galactose for 4 hr. In each panel, indirect immunofluorescence using one <br /> of three antibodies is shown. The lower panel shows 4&apos;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of the nucleus. In cells expressing only <br /> wild-type, HA-tagged PMAI, immunofluorescence using an anti-Pmal antibody is found only around the cell periphery, as expected for a plasma <br /> membrane protein (A). When similar cells are stained with anti-HA antibody (D), the same pattern is observed. When these cells are stained <br /> with an anti-Kar2 antibody, bright perinuclear staining is observed (G). In cells expressing the dominant lethal mutation, there is staining of <br /> the periphery and of several large cytoplasmic structures (B). When the similar cells are stained with anti-HA antibody, only the cytoplasmic <br /> structures are stained (E), indicating that the mutant protein does not get transported to the plasma membrane. When these cells are stained <br /> with anti-Kar2 antibody, the immunofluorescence is seen around the nucleus and in highly concentrated &quot;dots&quot; (H) similar to that observed <br /> with anti-HA antibody. Similar staining of cytoplasmic dots is seen when the dominant lethal mutation pmal-A135W is expressed and stained <br /> with anti-PMA1 antibody (C). <br /> the anti-Kar2 staining is found in dots similar to those                  four wild-type segregants in which the mutation was lost or <br /> observed for the mutant pmal-D378N protein (Fig. 3H).                     else only yielded two Ura- wild-type segregants and two <br />    Dominant Negative Mutations Are Also Found in the Region               slow-growing Ura+ segregants characteristic of a recessive <br /> of the First Two Transnembrane D             ns.

A third possibility        <br /> is that the mutant Pmal protein might be transported to the <br /> plasma membrane but then create unregulated ion channels           <br /> that could collapse the cell&apos;s membrane potential.
