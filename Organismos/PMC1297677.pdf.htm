(A) Heparin-binding behavior of S. <br /> cerevisiae 12-subunit (wtPol II) in the absence and presence of S. <br /> cerevisiae Fcp1 (scFcp1). Consistent amounts of the polymerase <br /> were loaded onto heparin Sepharose columns with or without <br /> the Fcp1, indicated respectively on the top. Consistent volumes <br /> of the flow-through (F.T.) and high-salt elution (Elut) were col- <br /> lected.

The amount <br /> of the polymerase relative to the control (lane 1 of B) in the <br /> flow-through was a function of the Fcp1&#20862;polymerase molar <br /> ratio. For four independent experiments, intensities of Rpb1 <br /> bands in lanes 5&#8211; 8 of B were normalized relative to that of WT <br /> Pol II alone in lane 1, which was low but not zero. The control for &#9004;4&#20862;7 alone was not included in the assay but was assumed to be identical to the WT Pol II control. <br /> Quantification of Rpb1b in the flow-through of C was done in the same manner, except that it was based on a single experiment.

Regardless of <br /> results have been reported in this regard (39, 53, 54).                                             the consequence on Pol II conformation, we know that the CTD is <br />    Aside from its CTD phosphatase function, Fcp1 induced a loss                                     not involved in this interaction (or loss of heparin binding) by the <br /> of heparin-binding affinity in Pol II. There has been no known <br />                                                                                                     fact that the CTD-less Pol IIB also lost its heparin-binding ability <br /> mechanism to date that could explain this noncatalytic activity of <br />                                                                                                     upon Fcp1 interaction (Fig. 3C). Thus, this secondary interaction <br /> Fcp1. But the sharply biased surface-charge distribution of Pol II <br /> (positive in the DNA&#20862;RNA cleft and negative elsewhere), which                                       must lie outside the CTD. If so, would this interaction involve a <br /> indicates that the polymerase binds heparin polymers in the cleft,                                  docking site on Pol II that had been proposed to be essential for <br /> prompted us to think that the loss of heparin binding may result                                    CTD dephosphorylation (27)? We think it does not, because the <br /> from three possible mechanisms: (i) an occlusion caused by direct                                   entire globular structure of Pol II (excluding the CTD) proved <br /> Fcp1 binding in the DNA&#20862;RNA site; (ii) a blockage of the cleft by                                   nonessential for the phosphatase function (see the discussion <br /> Fcp1 binding at its opening; and (iii) a closure of the cleft by the                                above). Rather, we speculate that Fcp1 interaction with the non- <br /> clamp domain (55&#8211;57). The first mechanism might be discounted by                                    CTD site may play phosphatase-independent roles, such as stimu- <br /> the considerations that (i) the DNA&#20862;RNA site is &#11015;75 &#197; deep but                                      lating elongation (39&#8211;41) by stabilizing the DNA&#20862;RNA <span id='am-81' about='obo:NCBITaxon_37965' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_12908 obo:NCBITaxon_1'><span id='am-82' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-83'  ></span><span id='am-84' property="rdfs:label" content="hybrid" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-85' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span>hybrid</span> in <br /> only 25 &#197; wide, a potential topological problem for a protein as                                    the cleft. <br /> large as pombe Fcp1 (82 kDa) and that (ii) the nucleic acid cleft is                                   The overall interaction between Fcp1 and Pol II appears dy- <br /> occupied by the DNA template and RNA transcript, which would                                        namic, as tested by gel filtration and affinity pulldown here and <br /> exclude Fcp1 from interacting with Pol II elongation complex,                                       nondenaturing electrophoresis previously (50). It is interesting to <br /> however Fcp1 was observed to stimulate a purified elongation                                        note that the Fcp1&#8211;Pol II complex is another example of dynam- <br /> complex (40). The second mode of interaction seems unlikely                                         icity-based interactions that mediate vital cellular processes, includ- <br /> because the opening above the nucleic acid cleft is occupied by the                                 ing signaling pathways and cell-surface recognitions (59&#8211;61). <br /> upstream DNA strands reannealing in the elongation complex (58); <br /> thus, Fcp1 would be precluded from contacting the elongation                                     <br /> complex. Again, however, Fcp1 was able to stimulate the rate of                                      <br /> elongation of the ternary complex (40).                                                           <br />    Assuming that the third mechanism is true, we speculate that a                                    <br /> closure of the cleft may be caused by Fcp1 interaction with a                                      <br />  <br /> </body></html>
