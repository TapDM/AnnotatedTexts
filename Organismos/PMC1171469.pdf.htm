(C) Membrane association of myc-tagged proteins expressed in yeast. Myc- <br /> tagged proteins were expressed in yeast, 100 000 g membrane pellets prepared and extracted with buffer, sodium chloride, sodium carbonate or <br /> Triton X-100 as indicated before recentrifugation and analysis of the pellets (P) and supernatants (S) by immunoblotting. (D) Protease protection <br /> assays. Membrane preparations containing the indicated proteins tagged at either the N- or C-terminus, as indicated, were digested with proteinase K <br /> in the presence or absence of detergent, and then analysed by immunoblotting. (E) Binding of anti-myc mAb 9E10 to unpermeabilized microsomes. <br /> Membranes from cells expressing the indicated myc-tagged proteins, or none (no myc), were incubated with antibody, pelleted and bound antibody <br /> light chains detected by immunoblotting. <br />  <br />  <br /> 3936 <br />                                                                                      Got1p and Sft2p Golgi transport proteins <br />  <br />  <br /> that of the wild-type strain (see Materials and methods <br /> for details). Thus Got1p evidently provides a function that <br /> is common to evolutionarily distant eukaryotes. <br />    For comparison, Figure 1A also shows the sequence of <br /> Sft2p, and related sequences from C.elegans and mouse <br /> (the latter a partial sequence from an EST). Though not <br /> closely related to Got1p, Sft2p also has a compact region <br /> of four putative transmembrane domains, and it is these <br /> that show most evolutionary conservation. <br />  <br /> Got1p and Sft2p are membrane proteins <br /> To investigate the membrane location of Got1p, the <br /> molecular clone was modified to encode three myc epitopes <br /> at the C-terminus of the protein. Yeast cells expressing <br /> this tagged protein produced a single product detectable <br /> on immunoblots with anti-myc antibodies, with an apparent <br /> size of ~25 kDa. Expression of the tagged protein from a <br /> centromere vector was sufficient to allow sectoring (i.e. <br /> loss of untagged Got1p) of the original got1-1 sft2&#8710; <br /> mutant strain, and also supported growth of the got1&#8710; <br /> sft2&#8710; double disruptant, indicating that the tagged Got1p <br /> is functional. A version of Sft2p tagged with three myc <br /> epitopes at the N-terminus has previously been described <br /> (Wooding and Pelham, 1998). <br />    Both Sft2p and Got1p were efficiently pelleted from        Fig. 2.

Kex2p endoprotease   <br /> activity was determined in each of these fractions (Cunningham and            <br /> Wickner, 1989) and in membrane pellets prepared from 100 000 g          <br /> centrifugation following a comparable procedure.                   <br /> Analysis of CPY and invertase processing                                     <br /> Pulse&#8211;chase analysis of carboxypeptidase Y was performed as described          <br /> by Stepp et al. (1997), although the incubation temperatures were either       <br /> 25 or 37&#176;C. Intracellular invertase was analysed as described by Holthuis     <br /> et al. (1998b).                                                  <br /> In vitro transport assays                                                   <br /> Yeast semi-intact cells from wild-type, got1&#8710; or sft2&#8710; strains were           <br /> prepared from log phase cultures grown at 25&#176;C and stored frozen at           <br /> &#8211;70&#176;C. Prior to assays, cells were quickly thawed, washed with buffer     <br /> to remove cytosol and [35S]prepro-&#945;-factor was post-translationally         <br /> translocated into ER membranes at 10&#176;C (Baker et al., 1988). Vesicle           <br /> budding, tethering and fusion assays were performed as described (Cao      <br /> et al., 1998). Briefly, the addition of purified COPII proteins buds           <br /> ER-derived vesicles from semi-intact cells that are freely diffusible and     <br /> remain in the supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 12 000 g.        <br /> Protease protected [35S]glyco-pro-(gp)-&#945;-factor contained in budded             <br /> vesicles was quantified after solubilization and precipitation with con-      <br /> canavalin A&#8211;Sepharose. For transport assays, COPII proteins in addition       <br /> to purified Uso1p and LMA1 were added as indicated in figure legends           <br /> and the amount of Golgi-modified [35S]gp-&#945;-factor was measured by            <br /> immunoprecipitation with &#945;1,6-mannose specific antibodies. For two-            <br /> stage vesicle fusion experiments, COPII vesicles that contained [35S]gp-       <br /> &#945;-factor were generated from wild-type and got1&#8710; membranes under              <br /> standard budding conditions (Cao et al., 1998). Freely diffusible vesicles      <br /> (10 &#181;l) were mixed with washed semi-intact cells from indicated strains        <br /> in a total volume of 25 &#181;l. The same membrane, protein and nucleotide        <br /> concentrations as in one-stage transport reactions were maintained in           <br /> these reactions. The extent of fusion with Golgi membranes was measured       <br /> after incubation at 25&#176;C by precipitation of Golgi modified [35S]gp-           <br /> &#945;-factor. The data plotted in these experiments are the average of          <br /> duplicate determinations and the error bars represent the range.               <br /> </body></html>
