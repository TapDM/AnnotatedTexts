It is encoded by the <br />           DKC1 gene, the gene mutated in X-linked dyskeratosis congenita, and is also part of the telomerase complex. <br />           The yeast ortholog, Cbf5, is an essential protein, but in mammals the effect of dyskerin ablation at the cellular <br />           level is not known. Here we show that mouse hepatocytes can survive after induction of a Dkc1 deletion. In the <br />           absence of dyskerin, rRNA processing is inhibited with the accumulation of large precursors, and fibrillarin <br />           does not accumulate in nucleoli. A low rate of apoptosis is induced in the hepatocytes, which show an induction <br />           of the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint pathway. Signs of liver damage including an increase in serum <br />           alanine aminotransferase activity and a disordered structure at the histological and macroscopic levels are <br />           observed. In response to carbon tetrachloride administration, when wild-type hepatocytes mount a rapid <br />           proliferative response, those without dyskerin do not divide. We conclude that hepatocytes can survive without <br />           dyskerin but that the role of dyskerin in RNA modification is essential for cellular proliferation. <br />  <br />  <br />    Modification of specific bases of newly synthesized ribo-                   &#8220;scaRNPs&#8221; are characterized by the presence in the scaRNA <br /> somal and spliceosomal RNAs is an early posttranscriptional                    of a conserved Sca motif (43) and function in the modification <br /> event and is carried out by specialized nucleolar complexes, the               of snRNAs (9), the small RNAs essential for pre-mRNA splic- <br /> snoRNPs.

The experiments pre- <br /> to mature 18S RNA and 32S being processed via 17S and 12S           sented here show that lack of dyskerin blocks rRNA processing <br /> intermediates to mature 5.8S RNA. The probes that we used           after cleavage of the primary transcript in ITS1 and leads to <br /> (Fig. 5) hybridize to the 30S, 32S, 17S, 12S, and 21S species and   disruption of ribosome biogenesis.

Together these data suggest                                     <br /> that in the absence of dyskerin the initial ITS1 cleavage event <br />                                                                       <br /> takes place but the 30S and 32S precursors are not processed        <br /> further, indicating that further processing requires pseudouri-      <br /> dylation of the nascent transcripts and/or an H/ACA RNA-            <br /> dependent cleavage event. Pseudouridylation of rRNA is              <br /> thought to take place on the early transcripts, prior to cleavage    <br /> in ITS1 (4, 11). Our results are compatible with recent studies     <br /> showing that while most cleavage events in rRNA processing, <br /> including those in the 5&#11032; ETS, require the participation of                                          <br /> snoRNPs, a cleavage site within ITS1 requires, at least in yeast,     <br /> only the action of the catalytic RNA RNase MRP (23, 30).              <br />    More compelling evidence that ribosome biogenesis is              <br /> halted in cells without dyskerin is our observation that in these        <br /> cells immunofluorescence with a fibrillarin antibody does not        <br /> show a brightly staining nucleolus as seen in wild-type cells.         <br /> Fibrillarin is the active methylase present in C/D snoRNPs,          <br /> and in ribosome biogenesis it is active on the same molecules        <br /> as is dyskerin. These molecules will not become pseudouridy-         <br /> lated in the absence of dyskerin, and our results suggest that       <br /> lack of pseudouridylation affects the action of C/D snoRNAs.       <br /> The mechanism underlying the apparent linkage between                   <br /> these 2 processes will be the subject of further experiments&#8212;         <br /> it will be interesting to know if lack of methylation inhibits       <br /> pseudouridylation. Moreover, the factors that maintain snoRNPs       <br /> in the nucleolus may be amenable to analysis in this system.         <br />    Dyskerin is essential for cell division. The second major             <br /> finding from our experiments is the absence of any cell division         <br /> in cells with no dyskerin. The dyskerin-depleted livers that we         <br /> studied showed a much-reduced proliferative response to liver       <br /> </body></html>
