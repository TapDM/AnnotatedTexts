It facilitates expression of <br />                                 homeobox genes and is also required for sister chromatid cohesion. Nipped-B is conserved from <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                 yeast to man, and its orthologs also play roles in deoxyribonucleic acid repair and meiosis. Mutation <br />                                 of the human ortholog, Nipped-B-Like (NIPBL), causes Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), <br />                                 associated with multiple developmental defects.

A key question, <br />                                 therefore, is whether the Nipped-B family regulates gene expression, meiosis, and development by <br />                                 controlling cohesin. To gain insights into Nipped-B&apos;s functions, we compared the effects of several <br />                                 Nipped-B mutations on gene expression, sister chromatid cohesion, and meiosis. We also examined <br />                                 association of Nipped-B and cohesin with somatic and meiotic chromosomes by immunostaining. <br />                                 Missense Nipped-B alleles affecting the same HEAT repeat motifs as CdLS-causing NIPBL <br />                                 mutations have intermediate effects on both gene expression and mitotic chromatid cohesion, linking <br />                                 these two functions and the role of NIPBL in human development. Nipped-B colocalizes extensively <br />                                 with cohesin on chromosomes in both somatic and meiotic cells and is present in soluble complexes <br />  <br />  <br />                            Correspondence to: Dale Dorsett. <br />                            F.

Heterozygous Nipped- <br />                                               B null mutants, which show only a 25 to 30% reduction in Nipped-B expression, are viable but <br />                                               have reduced cut and Ubx expression during imaginal disk development. <br />  <br />                                               Nipped-B encodes a member of a highly conserved protein family, which includes Scc2 and <br />                                               Mis4 of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, discovered in screens for factors that control sister <br />                                               chromatid cohesion (Furuya et al. 1998; Michaelis et al. 1997), C. cinereus Rad9 identified in <br />                                               a screen for factors required for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair and meiosis (Valentine <br />                                               et al. 1995), and human Nipped-B-Like (NIPBL/delangin), mutated in Cornelia de Lange <br />                                               syndrome (CdLS; Krantz et al. 2004; Tonkin et al. 2004). Nipped-B family proteins contain <br />                                               seven HEAT repeats implicated in protein&#8211;protein interactions (Neuwald and Hirano 2000), <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                               and NIPBL missense mutations in all seven cause CdLS (Gillis et al. 2004; Miyake et al. <br />                                               2005; Deardorff and Krantz, personal communication). <br />  <br />                                               Homozygous Drosophila Nipped-B mutants display defects in sister chromatid cohesion before <br />                                               they die, and depletion of vertebrate Nipped-B homologs in vitro or in cultured cells cause <br />                                               cohesion defects, showing that all are functional orthologs of Scc2 and Mis4 (Gillespie and <br />                                               Hirano 2004; Rollins et al. 2004; Seitan et al. 2006; Takahashi et al. 2004; Watrin et al. <br />                                               2006). Scc2 interacts with the Scc4 protein, which is also required for sister chromatid cohesion <br />                                               (Ciosk et al. 2000). Weakly conserved Scc4 homologs in S. pombe, C. elegans, Drosophila, <br />                                               and vertebrates interact with Nipped-B and its orthologs and function in sister chromatid <br />                                               cohesion and development (Bernard et al. 2006; Seitan et al. 2006; Watrin et al. 2006). <br />  <br />                                               The Nipped-B family is required for the cohesin protein complex that mediates sister chromatid <br />                                               cohesion to bind to chromosomes, which explains their role in cohesion (Arumugam et al. <br />                                               2003; Ciosk et al. 2000; Gillespie and Hirano 2004; Seitan et al. 2006; Takahashi et al. 2004; <br />                                               Tomonaga et al. 2000; Watrin et al. 2006). Cohesin consists of a heterodimer of the Smc1 and <br />                                               Smc3 structural maintenance of chromosome proteins, and two other proteins, the &#945;-kleisin <br />                                               Rad21 (Mcd1/Scc1) and Stromalin (SA/Scc3; reviewed in Hirano 2006; Nasmyth and Haering <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                               2005). The Rad21 termini interact with the head domains of Smc1 and Smc3, forming a ring- <br />                                               like structure. Many organisms contain meiosis-specific forms of some cohesin subunits, <br />                                               including Rec8 (Rad21 homolog) in yeast, C. elegans, and mammals and Smc1&#946; and Stag3 <br />                                               (SA homolog) in mammals (reviewed in Revenkova and Jessberger 2006). The situation <br />                                               regarding meiosis-specific cohesin subunits is less clear in Drosophila, which lacks an obvious <br />                                               Rec8 homolog. <br />  <br />                                               Cohesin is required but not sufficient for sister chromatid cohesion. Its ring-like structure is <br />                                               the basis of the current cohesion models, in which cohesin encircles two sister chromatids or <br />                                               cohesin rings bound to two sisters interlock with each other (Hirano 2006; Huang et al. 2005; <br />                                               Losada 2007; Nasmyth and Haering 2005). In some cases, a cohesin ring that encircles one <br />                                               sister may interact with proteins bound to the other sister to establish cohesion (Chang et al. <br />                                               2005). During interphase, cohesin binds numerous sites along chromosome arms and more <br />                                               densely to pericentric heterochromatin, where it is critical for cohesion at metaphase. <br />  <br />                                                   Chromosoma.

Page 3 <br />  <br />  <br />                                           Like the Nipped-B family, cohesin also has roles besides sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis, <br />                                           DNA repair, gene expression, and human development (reviewed in Dorsett 2007; Nasmyth <br />                                           and Haering 2005; Hagstrom and Meyer 2003; Hirano 2006; Revenkova and Jessberger <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           2006). Thus, a central question is whether regulation of cohesin also explains the functions of <br />                                           the Nipped-B family proteins in gene expression and meiosis.

A His6-Pds5 protein containing Pds5 residues encoded by <br />                                           exons 6, 7, and 8 of the Pds5 (CG17509) messenger RNA (mRNA) was prepared in the same <br />                                           manner and used to immunize a rabbit, and a His6-Rad21 fusion containing Rad21 residues 1&#8211; <br />                                           350 was used to immunize both a rabbit and a guinea pig. <br />  <br />                                           Antibody specificities were confirmed by immunostaining and Western blots. In Western blots <br />                                           of cultured cell extracts, both Rad21 antisera recognized the same protein slightly larger than <br />                                           the predicted size for Rad21 as previously reported (Vass et al. 2003). The Rad21 protein was <br />                                           coprecipitated by SA, Smc1, and Nipped-B antisera (see &#8220;Results&#8221;) and was reduced in Rad21 <br />                                           RNA interference (RNAi)-treated cells. In some extracts, two major Rad21 bands were <br />                                           observed. All preimmune sera showed only low-level background immunostaining, and the <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           Nipped-B, Pds5, and Rad21 antisera show staining that colocalizes with SA and Smc1 on <br />                                           polytene chromosomes (see &#8220;Results&#8221;). Homozygous pds5e3 mutants live to the third instar, <br />                                           and the maternal mRNA is virtually absent by the second instar stage (Dorsett et al. 2005). The <br />                                           salivary gland chromosomes from homozygous pds5e3 null mutants show staining for cohesin <br />                                           (Dorsett et al. 2005), but as expected, they show only background staining with the Pds5 <br />                                           antisera. By Western blots of whole-cell and nuclear extracts of cultured cells, whole-cell <br />                                           extracts of imaginal disks, adult ovaries, and embryos, the guinea pig Nipped-B antibody <br />                                           recognizes one major band close to the expected size (237 kDa) that is reduced in levels in <br />                                           embryos from heterozygous mutant mothers and cultured cells treated with anti-Nipped-B <br />                                           RNAi (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Similar primary antibody dilutions of 1:2,000 to 1:5,000 were used for SA, <br />                                           Smc1, Rad21, and Pds5. The SA and Smc1 antisera have been described previously (Dorsett <br />                                           et al. 2005). Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Western Lightening, Perkin Elmer) <br />                                           and autoradiography.

The beads were boiled in SDS- <br />                                           PAGE dye for 5 min, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE in 6% gels. Western blots <br />                                           were prepared and probed for cohesin subunits, Nipped-B, and Pds5 as described above. <br />  <br />                               Results <br />                               Identification of Nipped-B mutations <br />                                           We reasoned that if some of Nipped-B&apos;s functions do not involve cohesin, then it might be <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           possible to find Nipped-B separation-of-function mutations. For example, a mutation could <br />                                           cause recessive cohesion defects but not have dominant effects on gene expression. To <br />                                           investigate this possibility, we characterized several Nipped-B mutations that were induced in <br />                                           an isogenic cn bw chromosome by ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis (Myster et al. <br />                                           2004). To identify the mutations and distinguish them from polymorphisms, we sequenced <br />                                           Nipped-B transcripts from an isogenic cn bw stock kept in our laboratory, several EMS-induced <br />                                           mutant alleles, and compared them to the previously reported Nipped-B cDNA sequence <br />                                           (Rollins et al. 1999). <br />  <br />                                           The sequences revealed substantial amino acid coding variation in wild-type Nipped-B alleles, <br />                                           including differences in the number of residues (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition to the wild- <br />                                           type polymorphisms, we found significant alternative splicing at the N terminus, some of which <br />                                           alters the encoded protein (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                              Chromosoma.

Each missense mutation affects <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           a residue conserved in human NIPBL, and all are close to conserved residues altered by CdLS- <br />                                           causing missense NIPBL mutations (Fig. 2; Gillis et al. 2004;Miyake et al. 2005;Schoumans <br />                                           et al. 2007). Two other Nipped-B mutations, Nipped-BNC7 and Nipped-BNC59, truncate the <br />                                           encoded protein in the C-terminal region after the HEAT repeats, and four, Nipped-BNC6, <br />                                           Nipped-BNC23, Nipped-BNC41, and Nipped-BNC77, truncate the protein in the N-terminal region <br />                                           before the HEAT repeats.

All <br />                                           the mutations affect residues encoded by all splicing variants and thus are unlikely to produce <br />                                           any wild-type Nipped-B isoforms. <br />  <br />                                           All the EMS-induced mutations, including the three missense alleles, are recessive lethal at <br />                                           the second to third instar molt, the same as null alleles (Rollins et al. 1999). We tried to detect <br />                                           the truncated proteins by Western blot using antibodies generated against the N-terminal region <br />                                           of the protein in early embryos, which show the highest levels of Nipped-B protein because of <br />                                           maternal loading (Rollins et al. 1999). Only very minor amounts of Nipped-B protein migrating <br />                                           at the predicted smaller sizes, which could potentially be the truncated proteins, were detected <br />                                           in embryos from Nipped-BNC7/+ and Nipped-BNC59/+ mothers (Supplementary Fig. 1). The <br />                                           full-length maternal protein is reduced in level, and we deduce, therefore, that the truncated <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           forms of the protein are unstable. Because the truncation alleles are virtually equivalent to null <br />                                           alleles, it cannot be determined if the C-terminal residues are critical for specific Nipped-B <br />                                           functions. <br />  <br />                               Dominant effects of Nipped-B mutations on cut and Ultrabithorax phenotypes <br />                                           To determine if any of the EMS-induced mutations separate the gene expression and cohesion <br />                                           functions of Nipped-B, we measured their effects on cut and Ubx phenotypes and on sister <br />                                           chromatid cohesion. Nipped-B loss-of-function alleles generated by &#947;-rays, including Nipped- <br />                                           B407, Nipped-B292.1, and T(2;3)Nipped-B359.1, dominantly enhance the mutant phenotypes of <br />                                           some cut gene alleles and reduce expression of a wild-type cut gene (Rollins et al. 1999, <br />                                           2004). Similarly, Nipped-B loss-of-function alleles dominantly increase the severity of the <br />                                           bx34e allele of Ubx when it is partially suppressed by the su(Hw)e2 mutation (Rollins et al. <br />                                           1999). Homozygous Nipped-B mutations and heteroallelic combinations with the Nipped- <br />                                           B02047 P insertion allele cause sister chromatid cohesion defects before death (Rollins et al. <br />                                           2004). <br />  <br />                                           To measure effects of the EMS-induced Nipped-B mutations on cut expression, we used the <br />                                           wing-nicking phenotype caused by the ctK mutation. The ctK allele is an insertion of a gypsy <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           transposon that has fewer potential Su(Hw) insulator protein-binding sites. It causes partial <br />                                           loss of the adult wing margin by partially blocking the remote wing margin enhancer that drives <br />                                           cut expression during wing margin development. Decreases in ctK expression further reduce <br />                                           the amount of wing margin as quantified by counting the number of nicks or gaps in the bristle <br />                                           row along the adult wing margin (Dorsett et al. 2005; Gause et al. 2001; Rollins et al. 2004). <br />                                           Null Nipped-B alleles and in vivo Nipped-B RNAi increase the wing nicking displayed by <br />                                           ctK (Rollins et al. 2004). <br />  <br />                                           All the EMS-induced Nipped-B alleles dominantly increased the ctK wing nicking (Fig. 3). The <br />                                           two missense mutations affecting HEAT repeats, Nipped-BNC71 and Nipped-BNC78, exhibited <br />                                           a significantly weaker effect than the other alleles, while the other missense allele, Nipped- <br />                                           BNC39, had effects similar to the truncations. One of the C-terminal truncation alleles, Nipped- <br />                                           BNC59, reproducibly had stronger effects on the ctK phenotype than the others, but we cannot <br />                                           rule out the possibility that there are other mutations on this chromosome that enhance the <br />  <br />                                              Chromosoma.

It is also possible that small amounts of the truncated protein are present during wing <br />                                           margin development, and that this truncated protein might be antimorphic. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           All the EMS-induced Nipped-B alleles dominantly enhanced the bithorax phenotype of su <br />                                           (Hw)e2 bx34e, similar to the effects of null Nipped-B alleles (Rollins et al. 1999). Although the <br />                                           Nipped-BNC71 and Nipped-BNC78 missense mutations had the smallest effects, they were only <br />                                           slightly less than those caused by the other mutant alleles, suggesting that Ubx expression is <br />                                           more sensitive to reduced Nipped-B activity than is cut (Fig. 3). When the alleles are broken <br />                                           into three categories, missense, truncations after the HEAT repeats (C region truncations), and <br />                                           truncations before the HEAT repeats (N region truncations), the missense mutants as a group <br />                                           induce a significantly weaker bithorax phenotype than either of the truncation classes (5.0 vs <br />                                           5.4 and 5.5). Thus, as with cut, the missense mutants as a <span id='am-14' about='obo:NCBITaxon_class' typeof='owl:Thing NCBITaxon:_taxonomic_rank'><span id='am-15' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-16' property="rdfs:label" content="class" datatype="xsd:string"></span>class</span> have weaker effects on Ubx <br />                                           expression than do the truncation classes. <br />  <br />                               Recessive effects of Nipped-B mutations on sister chromatid cohesion <br />                                           We compared the effects of the Nipped-B alleles on sister chromatid cohesion by examining <br />                                           neuroblast metaphase nuclei for precocious sister chromatid separation (PSCS). To avoid <br />                                           effects of other potential recessive mutations, we tested heteroallelic combinations of each <br />                                           allele with the Nipped-B02047 P element insertion (Rollins et al. 1999, 2004). <br />  <br />                                           Table 1 shows the number of metaphases examined and the number of examples of PSCS <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           detected for each mutant, and Fig. 4 shows some examples of the PSCS phenotype. Because <br />                                           the Nipped-B alleles are recessive lethal before the molt to third instar and the mitotic index in <br />                                           the mutants is low, it is difficult to obtain enough metaphases to accurately measure the <br />                                           frequency of PSCS for each individual allele. To make statistical comparisons, therefore, the <br />                                           mutants were categorized into missense, C-terminal region truncation, and N-terminal region <br />                                           truncation classes as described above. All classes increase the frequency of PSCS compared <br />                                           to the wild-type control. The missense alleles, Nipped-BNC39, Nipped-BNC71, and Nipped- <br />                                           BNC78, individually and as a class gave a significantly lower frequency of PSCS (&#8764;30%) than <br />                                           did the truncation classes, which were similar to each other (59 and 62%) and the frequency <br />                                           reported for Nipped-B null alleles (61%, Rollins et al. 2004). Using Fisher&apos;s exact test, which <br />                                           is applicable when there are low sample numbers (Fisher 1922), the missense mutant class is <br />                                           significantly different from wild-type and both truncation classes, while the two truncation <br />                                           classes are not different from each other (Table 1). Thus, the missense mutants have weaker <br />                                           effects on both gene expression and sister chromatid cohesion than do truncation alleles, and <br />                                           as expected, both classes of truncation alleles have effects on gene expression and sister <br />                                           chromatid cohesion similar to those of null alleles. We conclude, therefore, that none of the <br />                                           nine EMS-generated alleles, including the three missense alleles, separate the gene expression <br />                                           and sister chromatid cohesion functions of Nipped-B. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                               Nipped-B, cohesin, and Pds5 colocalize on salivary polytene chromosomes <br />                                           If Nipped-B&apos;s roles in sister chromatid cohesion, gene expression, and meiosis all involve <br />                                           regulating cohesin function, we would expect Nipped-B and cohesin to colocalize on <br />                                           chromosomes. To test this, we double immunostained salivary gland polytene for Nipped-B <br />                                           and cohesin. In all the many nuclei examined, Nipped-B staining was completely coincident <br />                                           with staining for the Smc1 (Fig. 5) and SA cohesin subunits (not shown).

Similar to the results for Nipped-B, we found that the Pds5 protein, which <br />                                           is required for establishment and/or maintenance of cohesion in multiple organisms (Dorsett <br />                                           et al. 2005;Hartman et al. 2000;Losada et al. 2005;Panizza et al. 2000;Tanaka et al. 2001), also <br />                                           colocalizes with cohesin on polytene chromosomes (Fig. 5).

In S. pombe, interactions between the Swi6 <br />                                           HP1 ortholog and cohesin are important for sister chromatid cohesion (Bernard et al. 2001; <br />                                           Nonaka et al. 2002). In contrast to the colocalization of Nipped-B with cohesin, however, <br />                                           double-immunostaining experiments indicate that Nipped-B does not colocalize with HP1 on <br />                                           chromosomes (Fig. 5). The brightest regions of HP1 staining, which include the chromocenter <br />                                           and region 31B on the left arm of chromosome 2, stain weakly if at all for Nipped-B. A few <br />                                           bright Nipped-B bands stain weakly for HP1, but most do not. These results indicate that <br />                                           significant HP1&#8211;Nipped-B interactions do not occur on chromosomes. We cannot exclude the <br />                                           possibility that interactions with HP1 mask the epitopes recognized by the Nipped-B <br />                                           antibodies, but if this is the case, we deduce that such sites would lack cohesin, given the <br />                                           complete colocalization of Nipped-B and cohesin. <br />  <br />                                           It is possible that HP1-Nipped-B interactions occur only when the proteins are not associated <br />                                           with chromosomes. Nevertheless, the phenotypes of HP1 mutants indicate that if such <br />                                           interactions do occur, they are not critical for Nipped-B and cohesin function. It has been <br />                                           reported that polytene chromosomes appear relatively normal in HP1 [Su(var)2&#8211;5] mutants <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           and cohesion defects do not occur in any of the several tissues examined (Fanti et al. 1998). <br />                                           Polytene chromosomes that lack cohesin, on the other hand, show a significant change in <br />                                           morphology (Dorsett et al. 2005). <br />  <br />                               Nipped-B colocalizes with cohesin and the synaptonemal complex during female meiosis <br />                                           There is evidence in yeast and vertebrates that meiosis-specific forms of cohesin are involved <br />                                           in formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC; reviewed in Revenkova and Jessberger <br />                                           2006), and the mushroom Rad9 adherin mutant starts but fails to complete SC assembly (Seitz <br />                                           et al. 1996; Cummings et al. 2002). Rad9 mutants also show defective cohesion. Combined, <br />                                           these observations suggest that Nipped-B might also facilitate SC formation and/or <br />                                           maintenance by regulating cohesin function. <br />  <br />                                           We immunostained Drosophila oocyte chromosome spreads with anti-Nipped-B, and observed <br />                                           that it colocalizes extensively with the Smc1 and Smc3 cohesin subunits in a thread-like pattern <br />                                           along the arms of meiotic chromosomes (Fig. 6). It also colocalizes with the Ord protein, which <br />                                           is required for meiotic cohesion in both sexes and SC maintenance in oocytes (Bickel et al. <br />                                           1997;Khetani and Bickel 2007;Webber et al. 2004), and with C(3)G, a transverse filament <br />                                           protein that resides within the central element of the SC (Anderson et al. 2005). These data <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           argue that Nipped-B may play a direct role in regulating meiotic cohesion as well as SC <br />                                           structure and function. <br />  <br />                                           Although Nipped-B exhibits robust localization along the arms of meiotic chromosomes, <br />                                           centromeric Nipped-B staining was surprisingly weak or nonexistent (Fig. 6). In contrast to <br />                                           Nipped-B, bright staining for the cohesion proteins Ord and Smc1/Smc3 is visible in <br />                                           centromeric heterochromatin, which is identified by bright diamidinophenylindole staining and <br />                                           immunostaining for the CID centromere-specific histone (Fig. 6; Khetani and Bickel <br />                                           2007;Webber et al. 2004). These data suggest that Nipped-B may not associate strongly with <br />                                           meiotic centromeres and are consistent with the lack of Nipped-B signal at the centromeres of <br />                                           polytene chromosomes. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the epitopes <br />                                           recognized by Nipped-B antibodies are masked within pericentric heterochromatin. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                              Chromosoma.

The control and <br />                                           Nipped-B mutant J21A transmission frequencies all fall within the normal range (0.22 to 0.37) <br />                                           and are close to the wild-type average of 0.27 (Dobie et al. 2001). Thus, centromeric cohesion <br />                                           does not appear to be altered in heterozygous Nipped-B mutant females, and the early SC <br />                                           dissolution does not alter chromosome segregation during meiosis I. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                              Chromosoma.

To determine <br />                                           if Nipped-B forms complexes with cohesin, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments <br />                                           with nuclear extracts of Kc-cultured cells. We prepared extracts using moderate ionic strength <br />                                           and DNaseI digestion to release chromosome-bound cohesin and maximize the probability of <br />                                           detecting Nipped-B&#8211;cohesin complexes. <br />  <br />                                           As expected, immunoprecipitation with anti-Smc1 brings down high levels of the SA and <br />                                           Rad21 cohesin subunits, and precipitation with anti-SA coprecipitates high amounts of Smc1 <br />                                           and Rad21 (Fig. 9). In contrast, none of the cohesin subunit precipitations brought down <br />                                           detectable amounts of Nipped-B. Precipitation of Nipped-B, however, brought down small but <br />                                           detectable amounts of SA and Rad21 but not Smc1 (Fig. 9). Because the amounts were small, <br />                                           we repeated the experiment nine times with different nuclear extracts and a different cell line <br />                                           (MLDmD8) and always detected SA and Rad21 but not Smc1. <br />  <br />                                           A Rad21&#8211;SA subcomplex is present in Drosophila cultured cells (Vass et al. 2003), and the <br />                                           immunoprecipitation results thus suggest that there are small amounts of complexes that <br />                                           contain Nipped-B and the Rad21&#8211;SA subcomplex in nuclear extracts. These complexes likely <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           do not contain Smc1, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the anti-Nipped-B <br />                                           antibodies displace the Smc1&#8211;Smc3 heterodimer from the Rad21&#8211;SA subcomplex. Even so, <br />                                           these results, combined with the colocalization with cohesin on somatic and meiotic <br />                                           chromosomes, support the idea that Nipped-B is directly involved in regulating cohesin <br />                                           function. The apparent lack of stable association between Nipped-B and the complete cohesin <br />                                           complex suggests that such interactions are either less stable and more transient than those with <br />                                           the Rad21&#8211;SA subcomplex or that they may be stabilized by DNA. <br />  <br />                               Discussion <br />                                           In this study, we examined the functions of Drosophila Nipped-B in gene expression, mitotic <br />                                           sister chromatid cohesion, and meiosis. The results support the idea that Nipped-B&apos;s diverse <br />                                           functions in somatic and meiotic cells all involve regulation of cohesin function. <br />  <br />                               Nipped-B HEAT repeat mutations link Nipped-B&apos;s roles in gene expression and sister <br />                               chromatid cohesion <br />                                           Relative to null alleles, the missense Nipped-BNC71 and Nipped-BNC78 mutations that alter <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           HEAT repeats have weaker effects on both gene expression and sister chromatid cohesion. <br />                                           This agrees with prior studies suggesting that Nipped-B&apos;s role in gene expression is to regulate <br />                                           cohesin chromosome binding. The prior studies showed that Nipped-B facilitates activation of <br />                                           the cut gene by a distant transcriptional enhancer and that cohesin has an opposite effect to <br />                                           Nipped-B on cut expression (Rollins et al. 1999; Dorsett et al. 2005; Rollins et al. 2004). They <br />                                           also showed that cohesin binds to cut in multiple cell types and that a unique pds5 mutation <br />                                           that reduces binding of cohesin to chromosomes increases cut expression (Dorsett et al. <br />                                           2005). Combined, these findings and the genetic linkage between Nipped-B&apos;s roles in gene <br />                                           expression and sister chromatid cohesion reported here support the hypothesis that Nipped-B <br />                                           facilitates cut expression by alleviating negative effects of cohesin (Dorsett 2004, 2007). This <br />                                           model suggests that cohesin binding to cut inhibits expression and by maintaining a dynamic <br />                                           cohesin chromosome-binding equilibrium, Nipped-B facilitates cohesin removal or relocation. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                              Chromosoma.

In this scenario, the homozygous HEAT repeat <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           mutants show milder cohesion defects than null alleles because loading of cohesin onto <br />                                           chromosomes is only partially reduced, and the heterozygous mutants have weaker effects on <br />                                           gene expression because they only slightly alter the cohesin chromosome-binding equilibrium. <br />  <br />                                           The Nipped-BNC71 and Nipped-BNC78 missense mutations provide the first evidence that some <br />                                           of the HEAT repeats are important for gene expression and sister chromatid cohesion, and they <br />                                           also link Nipped-B&apos;s role in gene expression to the function of NIPBL and cohesin in human <br />                                           development. There are CdLS-causing missense mutations in all seven HEAT repeats of <br />                                           NIPBL, and Nipped-BNC71 and Nipped-BNC78 affect HEAT repeats 2 and 3, respectively <br />                                           (Gillis et al. 2004; Miyake et al. 2005; Deardorff and Krantz, personal communication). Indeed, <br />                                           Nipped-BNC71 and Nipped-BNC78 both affect conserved residues adjacent or very close to <br />                                           conserved residues affected by CdLS-causing mutations, and thus the CdLS mutations are <br />                                           likely to have dominant effects on gene expression similar to Nipped-BNC71 and Nipped- <br />                                           BNC78. The structural similarity between Nipped-BNC71 and Nipped-BNC78 and the NIPBL <br />                                           mutations provides a link to cohesin in human development because like the NIPBL HEAT <br />                                           repeat mutations, missense mutations in the Smc1 and Smc3 cohesin subunits also cause CdLS <br />                                           (Deardorff et al. 2007; Musio et al. 2006). <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                               Does Nipped-B directly regulate cohesin function? <br />                                           The functional connections between cohesin and the Nipped-B protein family in sister <br />                                           chromatid cohesion, gene expression, and development that have been revealed genetically <br />                                           likely reflect direct regulation of cohesin function by Nipped-B. This is supported by the finding <br />                                           that Nipped-B colocalizes with cohesin on polytene and meiotic chromosomes and the presence <br />                                           of soluble complexes containing Nipped-B and the Rad21 and SA cohesin subunits in cell <br />                                           nuclear extracts. We do not know why soluble complexes containing Nipped-B and whole <br />                                           cohesin were not detected, but it is possible that the antibodies used for immunoprecipitation <br />                                           disrupt these interactions, that the epitopes are masked in such complexes, that such interactions <br />                                           are transitory, or that they are stable only when Nipped-B and cohesin are both bound to DNA. <br />  <br />                                           In S. cerevisiae, cohesin does not colocalize with the Scc2 ortholog of Nipped-B on <br />                                           chromosomes (Lengronne et al. 2004). Nevertheless, purification of yeast Scc2&#8211;Scc4 complex <br />                                           brings along small amounts of cohesin subunits, and thus it has also been proposed that the <br />                                           Scc2&#8211;Scc4 complex also directly regulates binding of cohesin to chromosomes (Arumugam <br />                                           et al. 2003). It is suggested that cohesin loads at Scc2-binding sites and translocates away <br />                                           (Lengronne et al. 2004). In contrast, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using <br />                                           cultured Drosophila cells reveals that Nipped-B colocalizes with cohesin in the entire <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           nonrepetitive genome, confirming that their colocalization is not unique to polytene and <br />                                           meiotic chromosomes (Misulovin et al., submitted for publication). Thus, the separate <br />                                           localization of the Nipped-B/Scc2 cohesin loader and cohesin may be unique to yeast <br />                                           chromosomes. <br />  <br />                               Does Nipped-B regulate cohesin function at centromeres? <br />                                           Our results raise the possibility that Nipped-B is not critical for the function of cohesin at <br />                                           centromeres. Cohesin binds densely to pericentric heterochromatin, and cohesin at centromeres <br />                                           is protected in both mitotic and meiotic cells by a member of the Shugoshin/Mei-S332 protein <br />                                           family (Kitajima et al. 2004; McGuinness et al. 2005; Salic et al. 2004; Tang et al. 1998, <br />                                           2004). Although Nipped-B completely colocalizes with Smc1 and Smc3 along meiotic <br />                                           chromosome cores, we did not see Nipped-B staining around the centromeres, where cohesin <br />                                           staining is the strongest. We also did also not detect significant staining for Nipped-B at the <br />  <br />  <br />                                              Chromosoma.

Consistent with this idea, we also did not see <br />                                           strong cohesin staining at polytene centromeres.

We <br />                                           have immunostained metaphase chromosome spreads from Kc cells and can see Smc1 and SA <br />                                           that colocalizes with the CID centromere-specific histone at centromeres but have not been <br />                                           able to detect Nipped-B (Gause and Dorsett, unpublished). In this case, however, given the <br />                                           relatively weak signals, lack of staining elsewhere in the same nucleus, and the different <br />                                           fixation conditions needed to get good chromosome morphology, it is difficult to rule out the <br />                                           possibility that we cannot detect Nipped-B because of insufficient sensitivity. <br />  <br />                                           Although the lack of pericentric Nipped-B staining in meiotic chromosomes might be caused <br />                                           by epitope masking, other evidence indicates that Nipped-B function is also not critical at <br />                                           meiotic centromeres. In particular, the retention of Smc1 and Smc3 protein at the meiotic <br />                                           chromosome centromeres in heterozygous Nipped-B mutants and the normal meiotic <br />                                           transmission of the J21A minichromosome with a weak centromere indicate that centromeric <br />                                           cohesion is not altered, although the chromosome cores disintegrate early when the dosage of <br />                                           Nipped-B protein is reduced. This contrasts sharply with the chromosome nondisjunction and <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           lack of cohesin binding to the meiotic centromeres in ord mutants (Khetani and Bickel 2007). <br />                                           Thus, the evidence suggests that either Nipped-B does not play a critical role in the function <br />                                           of cohesin at meiotic centromeres or that its role at centromeres is not as dosage sensitive as <br />                                           its function along the chromosome cores. Given the lack of Nipped-B staining, the <br />                                           colocalization of Ord and cohesin, and the lack of cohesin at centromeres in ord mutants, it is <br />                                           possible that Ord functionally substitutes for Nipped-B at meiotic centromeres. <br />  <br />                               Roles of Nipped-B in meiosis <br />                                           Our data provide evidence for a functional link between the Nipped-B protein family and <br />                                           cohesin in meiosis.

Meiotic chromosomes at the indicated stages of meiosis and <br />                                           oogenesis were visualized by staining for Smc1/3 and C(3)G protein in wild-type and Nipped- <br />                                           B10E heterozygous mutant ovarioles (whole-mount preparation). Nipped-B10E is a null-like <br />                                           allele generated by P element excision. The developmental stages (germarium regions 2A, 2B, <br />                                           3, and stage 2 of oogenesis) are organized in temporal order from the top down. During wild- <br />                                           type prophase I, the synaptonemal complex first forms in region 2A of the germarium, becomes <br />                                           restricted to the oocyte by region 3, and remains stable until stage 6 of oogenesis. In <br />                                           heterozygous Nipped-B mutants, formation of the chromosome cores in region 2A appears to <br />                                           occur normally, but the cores fragment (lose their linear structure) in germarium region 3 to <br />                                           stage 2 of oogenesis, which is substantially earlier than in the wild type. Despite the early <br />                                           fragmentation, Smc1/3 staining is retained at the centromeres. The bright Smc1/3 spots in the <br />                                           stage 2 oocyte also stain for CID, a centromere-specific histone H3 variant (Fig. 8). Temporal <br />                                           progression of fragmentation defects was quantified in 42 Nipped-B10E/+ ovarioles and <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           revealed that more than 50% of region 3 and more than 90% of stage 2 oocytes exhibit extensive <br />                                           fragmentation of chromosome cores. Similar results were obtained with other Nipped-B alleles <br />                                           (see text).
