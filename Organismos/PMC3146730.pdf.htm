We screened for mutations in PRPF6 (NM_012469.3), <br /> a gene on chromosome 20q13.33 encoding an essential protein for tri-snRNP assembly and stability, in 188 unrelated patients with auto- <br /> somal-dominant RP and identified a missense mutation, c.2185C&gt;T (p.Arg729Trp). <span id='am-7' about='obo:NCBITaxon_169495' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_33340 obo:NCBITaxon_33213 obo:NCBITaxon_169440 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_7147 obo:NCBITaxon_43733 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_43738 obo:NCBITaxon_480117 obo:NCBITaxon_33317 obo:NCBITaxon_169449 obo:NCBITaxon_480118 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_6072 obo:NCBITaxon_6960 obo:NCBITaxon_43750 obo:NCBITaxon_33208 obo:NCBITaxon_85512 obo:NCBITaxon_197562 obo:NCBITaxon_197563 obo:NCBITaxon_7203 obo:NCBITaxon_6656 obo:NCBITaxon_7496 obo:NCBITaxon_1206794 obo:NCBITaxon_88770 obo:NCBITaxon_33392 obo:NCBITaxon_169455 obo:NCBITaxon_50557 obo:NCBITaxon_43741'><span id='am-8' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-9'  ></span><span id='am-10' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-11' property="rdfs:label" content="This" datatype="xsd:string"></span>This</span> change affected a residue that is conserved from <br /> humans to yeast and cosegregated with the disease in the <span id='am-1' about='obo:NCBITaxon_family' typeof='owl:Thing NCBITaxon:_taxonomic_rank'><span id='am-2' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-3' property="rdfs:label" content="family" datatype="xsd:string"></span>family</span> in which it was identified. Lymphoblasts derived from patients with this <br /> mutation showed abnormal localization of endogenous PRPF6 within the nucleus. Specifically, this protein accumulated in the Cajal <br /> bodies, indicating a possible impairment in the tri-snRNP assembly or recycling. Expression of GFP-tagged PRPF6 in HeLa cells showed <br /> that this phenomenon depended exclusively on the mutated form of the protein. Furthermore, analysis of endogenous transcripts in <br /> cells from patients revealed intron retention for pre-mRNA bearing specific splicing signals, according to the same pattern displayed <br /> by lymphoblasts with mutations in other PRPF genes. Our results identify PRPF6 as the sixth gene involved in pre-mRNA splicing <br /> and dominant RP, corroborating the hypothesis that deficiencies in the spliceosome play an important role in the molecular pathology <br /> of this disease. <br />  <br /> Mutations in more than 50 genes cause retinitis pigmentosa                involve the dynamic assembly and disassembly of snRNP <br /> (RP [MIM 268000]), a form of retinal degeneration with an                 subcomplexes.
