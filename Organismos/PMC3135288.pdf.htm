Yeast smc5/6 mutants are hypersensitive to DNA damage, and Smc5/6 is recruited <br />           to HO-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs), facilitating intersister chromatid recombinational repair. To <br />           determine the role of the vertebrate Smc5/6 complex during the normal cell cycle, we generated an Smc5- <br />           deficient chicken DT40 cell line using gene targeting. Surprisingly, Smc5&#11546; cells were viable, although they <br />           proliferated more slowly than controls and showed mitotic abnormalities. Smc5-deficient cells were sensitive <br />           to methyl methanesulfonate and ionizing radiation (IR) and showed increased chromosome aberration levels <br />           upon irradiation. Formation and resolution of Rad51 and gamma-H2AX foci after irradiation were altered in <br />           Smc5 mutants, suggesting defects in homologous recombinational (HR) repair of DNA damage. Ku70&#11546;/&#11546; <br />           Smc5&#11546; cells were more sensitive to IR than either single mutant, with Rad54&#11546;/&#11546; Smc5&#11546; cells being no more <br />           sensitive than Rad54&#11546;/&#11546; cells, consistent with an HR function for the vertebrate Smc5/6 complex. Although <br />           gene targeting occurred at wild-type levels, recombinational repair of induced double-strand breaks was <br />           reduced in Smc5&#11546; cells. Smc5 loss increased sister chromatid exchanges and sister chromatid separation <br />           distances in mitotic chromosomes. We conclude that Smc5/6 regulates recombinational repair by ensuring <br />           appropriate sister chromatid cohesion. <br />  <br />  <br />    Three highly conserved structural maintenance of chromo-                  budding and fission yeasts.

Together, these data suggest that one role <br /> of Smc5 is to ensure the normal proximity of sister chromatids, <br /> although we did not see the marked loss of cohesion described <br /> for experiments that used RNAi to deplete Smc5 from HeLa <br /> cells (4). <br />    An observation made in previous analyses of Scc1-deficient <br /> DT40 cells was that sister chromatids remained associated <br /> even though cohesin was reduced to undetectable levels (52). <br /> This contrasted with the entire loss of sister chromatid cohe- <br /> sion seen after extended periods of shugoshin depletion (28). <br /> To test whether Smc5/6 might have roles separate from cohe- <br /> sin in allowing cohesion, we disrupted Smc5 in the conditional <br /> Scc1 cell line and then repressed Scc1 (Fig. 4F and G). As <br /> shown in Fig. 4H, there was no exacerbation of the end-stage <br /> Scc1-deficient phenotype caused by the loss of Smc5, in that <br /> the sister chromatids remain associated with one another and <br /> do not lose all cohesion. We take these results to demonstrate <br /> that Smc5 is epistatic to Scc1 in cohesion maintenance. <br />    Involvement of Smc5 in postreplicative DNA repair pro- <br /> cesses. We next tested the involvement of vertebrate Smc5 in <br /> DNA repair using clonogenic survival assays. Smc5-deficient <br /> cells were moderately sensitive to IR (Fig. 5A). We next per- <br /> formed an epistasis experiment to define the DSB repair path- <br /> way in which Smc5 acts. Based on the expected activities of the <br /> Smc5/6 complex, we hypothesized that Smc5 would be involved <br /> in RAD52 epistasis group activities. This hypothesis predicts <br /> that additional loss of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) <br /> activity would lead to increased sensitivity to DSBs in double <br /> mutants with mutations in Smc5 and an NHEJ gene. Such a <br /> synergistic effect has been described for double mutants with <br /> mutations in the Ku NHEJ gene and the HR gene Rad54 (9, <br /> 58).
