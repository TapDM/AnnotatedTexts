As shown in Fig. 5 (B and C), <br />  <br />  <br />     284   JCB &#8226; VOLUME 185 &#8226; NUMBER 2 &#8226; 2009 <br />  Puma&#57394;/&#57394; and Bax&#57394;/&#57394; cells were refractory to caspase 3 activa- <br /> tion and cell death induced by lentivirus-mediated down- <br /> regulation of Bcl-xL. Of note, a recombinant lentivirus targeting <br /> Bcl-2 had a strikingly weaker effect on cell viability than the <br /> shBcl-xL lentivirus, but its feeble effect was also Puma depen- <br /> dent (unpublished data). Interestingly, Fig. 5 A suggests that <br /> cell death induced by Bcl-xL knockdown in control cells may <br /> be slowed down by the unexpected ability of this knockdown to <br /> decrease Puma expression. The mechanism involved, which <br /> was also detected in Bax-deficient cells, remains to be charac- <br /> terized. It should also be noted that knockdown of Bcl-xL in <br /> control cells provoked the apparition of a truncated form of Bax <br /> of an apparent molecular mass of 18 kD. This may be a conse- <br /> quence of the induction of cell death, as this truncation, which <br /> has been reported in many cases of apoptosis induction and re- <br /> sults in the removal of Bax H&#57441;1 from the rest of the molecule <br /> (Cartron et al., 2004b), was not observed in Puma-deficient <br /> cells. In all cases, the view that emerges from these assays is <br /> that Bcl-xL acts in an ABT-737&#8211;sensitive manner to counteract <br /> a constitutive Puma-related death signal. <br />  <br /> Puma mediates apoptosis induced by <br /> pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-xL <br /> combined with Mcl-1 down-regulation <br /> ABT-737 does not inhibit Mcl-1 (Oltersdorf et al., 2005), and <br /> Puma does interact with this survival protein (Chen et al., 2005). <br /> Thus, the involvement of Puma in the aforementioned deleteri- <br /> ous effects of ABT-737 may rely on the ability of this protein to <br /> counteract Mcl-1 rather than on its ability to activate Bax di- <br /> rectly. We analyzed whether Puma was still involved in the in- <br /> duction of death by ABT-737 in cells devoid of Mcl-1. Because <br /> we were unable to produce a lentivirus construct that would sig- <br /> nificantly knock down Mcl-1 in HCT116 cells, we used a previ- <br /> ously published procedure in which siRNAs targeting Mcl-1 <br /> were transiently transfected (Fig. 6 A; Maiuri et al., 2007). Mcl-1 <br /> knockdown by transfection of siRNAs induced only a modest <br /> increase in the amount of cells with released cytochrome c and <br /> active caspase 3 by itself (Fig. 6 B), but it allowed a more effi- <br /> cient induction of these apoptotic events by a 24-h treatment <br /> with 1 &#181;M ABT-737 in control cells.
