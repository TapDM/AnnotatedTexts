The ability cells respond activation Toll like receptors <br />      (TLR) critical innate immune sensing tissues, extends general danger sensing, e.g. oxidative <br />      stress, cardiomyocytes. We used biomarker release gene-array analysis compare responses hESC and <br />      differentiation, primary human endothelial cells. The presence cardiomyocytes endothelial cells <br />      confirmed differentiated cultures immunostaining, FACS-sorting and, cardiomyocytes, beating activity. <br />      Undifferentiated hESC did respond CXCL8 release Gram positive Gram negative bacteria, range PAMPs <br />      (pathogen associated molecular patterns) TLRs 1-9 (apart flagellin, activator TLR5). Surprisingly, lack TLR- <br />      dependent responses maintained 4 months differentiation hESC, cultures included cardiomyocytes <br />      endothelial cells. In contrast, primary cultures human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) demonstrated responses a <br />      broad range PAMPs. Expression downstream TLR signalling pathways demonstrated hESC, IL-1b, TNFa and <br />      INFc, bypass TLRs, stimulated CXCL8 release. NFkB pathway expression present hESC NFkB was <br />      able translocate nucleus. Low expression levels TLRs detected hESC, especially TLRs 1 4, explaining <br />      lack response hESC main TLR signals. TLR5 levels similar differentiated hESC HAEC, and <br />      siRNA knockdown TLR5 abolished response flagellin.
