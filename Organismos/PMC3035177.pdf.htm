One clone was isolated from these screens and sequenced. It was found to code for <br />                                                           a unique 16-mer peptide that was named lpg1. The sequence of lpg1 did not resemble any <br />                                                           amino acid sequence motifs (or other amino acid sequence parts) of the DnaB sequence and <br />                                                           is presented in Figure 1F. We proceeded to test its antagonist function, not only against the <br />                                                           DnaB-P16 interaction, but also against the full-length DnaB-DnaG interaction applying <br />                                                           again our reverse Y3H approach, and confirmed that, indeed, it inhibited this interaction <br />                                                           (Figures 2A&#8211;2C). Our data show that lpg1 clearly inhibits the DnaB-DnaG and DnaB-P16 <br />                                                           interactions in our reverse Y3H system. <br />  <br />                                                           The configuration of our reverse Y3H system ensured that the GAL4AD-peptide would <br />                                                           interact exclusively with the GAL4AD-P16 for antagonist activity to be apparent in our <br />                                                           screens (Figure 1E). An interaction between GAL4AD-peptide and GAL4BD-DnaB will <br />                                                           simply result in &#946;-galactosidase expression. Our system also offers the flexibility for <br />                                                           selecting antagonist peptides that will interact exclusively with the other partner in the <br />                                                           complex. For example, a GAL4BD-peptide fusion would result in negative signal only if it <br />                                                           interacts with GAL4BD-DnaB, whereas, in this case, an interaction with GAL4AD-P16 will <br />                                                           result in positive signal. Therefore, the antagonist activity of the isolated lpg1 peptide must <br />                                                           be due to specific interactions with P16 (or DnaG) that exclude DnaB from the complex.

As expected, lpg1 was <br />                                                           found to interact with DnaG (Figures 2D and 2E). In contrast, lpg1 did not interact with <br />                                                           DnaB when tested in a similar manner using the pASB instead of the pASG plasmid (data <br />                                                           not shown). <br />  <br />                                            Antagonist Activity In Vitro <br /> Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                           Confirmation of the antagonist activity of lpg1 against the DnaB-DnaG complex formation <br />                                                           was verified by examining its effect on the DnaG-mediated stimulation of the ATPase <br />                                                           activity of DnaB in vitro. Purified B. stearothermophilus DnaB and DnaG proteins form a <br />                                                           stable complex that can be isolated by gel filtration [20, 21]. The ATPase activity of DnaB is <br />                                                           stimulated significantly when in complex with DnaG [20, 21]. However, the DnaB-DnaG <br />                                                           system is particularly complex, because (1) the stoichiometry of the complex is not absolute <br />                                                           and (2) the ATPase kinetic behavior of DnaB is still unresolved. Although the majority of <br />                                                           the complexes exist in a DnaB6-DnaG3 stoichiometry, a significant percentage of complexes <br />                                                           with DnaB6-DnaG2 and DnaB6-DnaG1 stoichiometry also exist [20, 21]. The complexity of <br />                                                           this system is amplified further by the ATPase kinetic behavior of DnaB. It does not obey <br />                                                           first order Michaelis Menten kinetics [20, 21] and the relative kinetic behavior of the <br />                                                           heterogeneous complexes is far from certain. <br />  <br />                                                           Despite the complexity of this system, we argued that if lpg1 reversibly competes with <br />                                                           DnaB for binding to DnaG, the stimulatory effect on the DnaB ATPase activity by DnaG <br />                                                           should be inhibited in the presence of lpg1, because lpg1 will bind to DnaG and prevent the <br />                                                           DnaB-DnaG complex formation. Obviously, we cannot be certain whether all three DnaG <br />                                                           molecules need to be disengaged from the complex or if only one or two DnaG molecules <br />                                                           need to be disengaged before inhibition of the stimulatory effect can be observed. Indeed <br />                                                           DnaB6-DnaG2 and DnaB6-DnaG1 complexes may still exhibit stimulated ATPase activity. <br />                                                           Despite these complications, we would anticipate that removing all three DnaG molecules <br />                                                           from the complex will lead to inhibition of the DnaG-mediated stimulatory effect on DnaB <br />                                                           ATPase activity. <br />  <br />                                                           We tested this hypothesis employing two different ATPase assays: a continuous NADH- <br /> Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                           linked assay that indirectly measures the rate of ATP hydrolysis by monitoring the oxidation <br />                                                           of NADH to NAD+ and an end-point TLC-based assay that directly measures the conversion <br />                                                           of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi).

We <br />                                                           investigated the direct effect of lpg1 on the complex by gel filtration.

We discovered that <br />                                                           adding an excess of lpg1 (175 &#956;M) in the DnaB (0.5 &#956;M hexamer)-DnaG (0.67 &#956;M <br />                                                           monomer) mixture resulted in the release of a substantial amount of DnaG from the <br />                                                           complex, confirming that lpg1 competes with DnaB for binding to DnaG.

Lpg1 has to compete with the DnaB helicase and displace it from the <br />                                                           preformed DnaB-DnaG complex. Although the affinity of lpg1 for DnaG is in the <br />                                                           nanomolar region (Supplemental Data), apparently DnaB also binds to DnaG with very high <br />                                                           affinity, and not all of the DnaB could be displaced from DnaG by lpg1. Also, as the <br />                                                           proteins in the mixture are loaded onto the top of the column, they begin to separate almost <br />                                                           immediately.
