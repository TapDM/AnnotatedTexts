For these studies, we have used a conditional Stu2p depletion <br />         strain expressing &#9251;-tubulin fused to green fluorescent protein. Depletion of Stu2p leads to fewer <br />         and less dynamic cytoplasmic microtubules in both G1 and preanaphase cells. The reduction in <br />         cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics is due primarily to decreases in both the catastrophe and <br />         rescue frequencies and an increase in the fraction of time microtubules spend pausing. These <br />         changes have significant consequences for the cell because they impede the ability of cytoplasmic <br />         microtubules to orient the spindle. In addition, recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching <br />         indicates that kinetochore microtubules are no longer dynamic in the absence of Stu2p. This <br />         deficiency is correlated with a failure to properly align chromosomes at metaphase. Overall, we <br />         provide evidence that Stu2p promotes the dynamics of microtubule plus-ends in vivo and that <br />         these dynamics are critical for microtubule interactions with kinetochores and cortical sites in the <br />         cytoplasm. <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                          vitro have been identified, their relative importance and <br />                                                                       precise roles in vivo are not yet well understood. <br /> The dynamic nature of the microtubule cytoskeleton is es-                Individual microtubules exhibit stochastic transitions be- <br /> sential for its function in a variety of cellular processes such      tween states of growth and shrinkage, a behavior known as <br /> as organelle organization and chromosome segregation.

Transitions <br /> terestingly, microtubules in vivo are much more dynamic               from growth to shrinkage are called catastrophes; transitions <br /> than microtubules assembled from pure tubulin. To account             from shrinkage to growth are rescues.

Kosco et al. <br />  <br />  <br />    As cells lacking Stu2p contain fewer and less dynamic <br /> cytoplasmic microtubules, we asked whether these changes <br /> affect the ability of cytoplasmic microtubules to orient spin- <br /> dles. We grew stu2cu cells expressing GFP-Tub1p in copper- <br /> containing medium for at least 4 h and obtained random <br /> images of spindles in live cells. As a control, STU2 cells <br /> expressing GFP-Tub1p were treated with hydroxyurea to <br /> arrest them with preanaphase spindles. We measured the <br /> distance of the closest end of the spindle to the mother-bud <br /> neck and the angle of the spindle relative to the mother-bud <br /> axis (Figure 3B). The position and angle of preanaphase <br /> spindles appeared random in stu2cu cells. The mean spindle- <br /> to-bud neck distance was 2.2 &#11006; 1.1 &#9262;m in stu2cu cells vs. <br /> 1.0 &#11006; 0.5 &#9262;m in STU2 cells (n &#11005; 98, 117; p &#11021; 0.001). The mean <br /> spindle orientation angle was 53 &#11006; 25&#176; in stu2cu cells vs. 22 &#11006; <br /> 19&#176; in STU2 cells (n &#11005; 98, 117; p &#11021; 0.001). <br />    The defect observed in stu2cu cells is indicative of a block <br /> in the early pathway of spindle orientation. Genetic experi- <br /> ments, with the use of two temperature-sensitive alleles of <br /> STU2, stu2&#8211;10 and stu2&#8211;13, were consistent with this inter- <br /> pretation. stu2&#8211;10 and stu2&#8211;13 strains were crossed to strains <br /> containing either a deletion of KAR9 (kar9&#9004;) or DHC1 <br /> (dhc1&#9004;), and the double mutants were analyzed. Both <br /> stu2&#8211;10 kar9&#9004; and stu2&#8211;13 kar9&#9004; double mutants grew well. <br /> However, a large fraction of the stu2&#8211;10 dhc1&#9004; and stu2&#8211;13 <br /> dhc1&#9004; double mutant spores were inviable (30% and 60%, <br /> respectively) and those that were viable grew slowly. Be- <br /> cause only cells compromised in both pathways display <br /> growth defects, these results are consistent with Stu2p play- <br /> ing a role in the early Kar9p-dependent pathway for spindle <br /> orientation. <br />  <br />  <br /> Kinetochore Microtubules Are Less Dynamic in <br /> Stu2p-depleted Cells <br /> The haploid S. cerevisiae spindle contains 16 kinetochore         Figure 5.

Elimination of the spindle checkpoint does allow <br />                                                                    <br /> cells to progress through the cell cycle but does not abrogate <br /> the spindle elongation defect, indicating that Stu2p plays a        <br /> structural role in spindle elongation. Stu2p-depleted cells         <br />                                                                   <br /> also fail to elongate spindles. A few Stu2p-depleted cells <br /> begin spindle elongation, but these spindles break at &#11011;3&#8211;5         <br /> &#9262;m in length. This breakage could be due to a weak arrange-       <br /> ment of polar microtubules or to a defect in elongating these      <br /> microtubules once anaphase begins. We have not been able           <br /> to measure the effect of Stu2p depletion on the dynamics of        <br /> polar microtubules. But given that Stu2p promotes the dy-           <br /> namics of cytoplasmic and kinetochore microtubules, it            <br /> seems reasonable to propose that Stu2p may promote the              <br /> dynamics of polar microtubules as well. Consistent with this      <br /> hypothesis, Stu2p localizes to the midregion of spindles,          <br /> where the plus-ends of the polar microtubules reside. As            <br /> polar microtubules must find their counterparts from the           <br /> opposite pole, decreasing microtubule dynamics could im-           <br /> pede this process and lead to the assembly of defective            <br /> spindles that are unable to elongate. Alternatively, Stu2p        <br /> may be involved in the switch that allows polar microtu- <br />                                                                     <br /> bules to lengthen at anaphase B onset. Although Stu2p de-           <br /> pletion does not alter the length of cytoplasmic microtu-          <br /> bules, it may have a different effect on polar microtubules.       <br /> The nucleus and the cytoplasm likely contain distinct sets of <br />                                                                   <br /> proteins capable of influencing microtubule dynamics, so            <br /> the relative contribution of Stu2p to microtubule assembly          <br /> may differ in these two compartments.                              <br />                                                                     <br /> Stu2p and XMAP215                                                   <br />                                                                     <br /> Contrary to the role of XMAP215 that dampens microtubule            <br /> dynamics in Xenopus extracts, Stu2p promotes microtubule <br /> dynamics in yeast. These opposite effects may reflect differ-      <br /> ences in the intrinsic activities of these two proteins, a prop- <br />                                                                    <br /> erty that has not yet been determined for Stu2p. However, it <br /> seems likely that this discrepancy results, at least in part,       <br /> from differences in growing yeast cells and Xenopus egg             <br /> extracts. Microtubules in yeast are considerably less dy-           <br /> namic than microtubules in Xenopus extracts and animal              <br /> cells in general (Carminati and Stearns, 1997; Shaw et al.,         <br /> 1997b).
