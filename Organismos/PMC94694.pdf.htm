We describe here a genetic construct (UAU1) for which two copies may be selected. <br />           Insertion of UAU1 into one genomic site, after a single transformation, allows selection for segregants with two <br />           copies of the insertion. Major classes of segregants are those carrying homozygous insertion mutations and <br />           allelic triplications, which have two insertion alleles and a wild-type allele. Thus nonessential and essential <br />           genes may be distinguished rapidly through PCR tests for homozygosis and triplication. We find that homozy- <br />           gous mutations may be isolated at three nonessential loci (ADE2, RIM20, and YGR189), while only allelic <br />           triplications were found at two essential loci (SNF1 and CDC28). We have unexpectedly isolated homozygous <br />           mutants with mutations at CDC25; they are viable but defective in filamentation on serum-containing medium. <br />           The UAU1 cassette is thus useful to assess rapidly the essentiality of C. albicans genes. <br />  <br />  <br />    Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen.

These findings support the idea that                     tual genotype would be chs2::UAU1/CHS2/CHS2.

In the past, this analysis has required two successive                  tant question that we have not yet resolved: how large a DNA <br /> transformations to create homozygous null mutations or con-                     segment becomes homozygous in the Arg&#11001; Ura&#11001; homozygous <br /> ditionally expressed alleles (1, 7, 30, 43). These methods allow                disruption mutants? Given that natural C. albicans isolates are <br /> construction of precisely defined mutant strains that can be                    heterozygous for preexisting mutations (31, 40&#8211;42), it is possi- <br /> ble that selection for homozygosity of a UAU1 insertion mu-        <br /> tation may yield homozygosity of a linked mutation as well. In  <br /> our small survey of known nonessential genes, we found only       <br /> homozygotes that had phenotypes consistent with traditionally                  <br /> constructed mutants. However, the possibility that a linked             <br /> mutation may become homozygous remains an important ca-            <br /> veat for any conclusion derived solely from double-disruption           <br /> selection.                                                                <br />    Our estimates of mitotic recombination rates point to a   <br /> surprising conclusion: that heterozygous mutations become      <br /> homozygous at a rate of 2 &#11003; 10&#11002;3 per division. We calculate      <br /> this rate from the rate of production of detectable homozy-     <br /> gotes (&#11011;1 &#11003; 10&#11002;8 per division) and the rate of recombination      <br /> to generate URA3 from UAU1 (&#11011;3 &#11003; 10&#11002;6 per division). This      <br /> homozygosis rate is 102- to 103-fold higher than expected from   <br /> studies of S. cerevisiae (24) and violates anecdotal common         <br /> knowledge derived from use of Ura-blaster cassettes to create            <br /> gene disruptions (7, 43). One simple explanation is that our            <br /> estimate of the rate of recombination to generate URA3 from  <br /> UAU1 may be artificially low because of a selective advantage         <br /> of Arg&#11001; cells during growth in broth culture. However, in         <br /> coculture experiments, we have not detected such an advan-            <br /> tage (B. Enloe and A. P. Mitchell, unpublished results). A       <br /> second explanation is that our frequency estimates are in error  <br /> because of differences in growth dynamics on the selective               <br /> plates. Thus, for example, Ura&#11001; colonies might arise only from               <br /> preexisting recombinants, while Arg&#11001; Ura&#11001; colonies might                <br /> arise during growth after plating. A third explanation is that   <br /> the event that generates URA3 in a UAU1 insertion heterozy-     <br /> gote is not equivalent to the event that generates URA3 in a        <br /> homozygote or triplication derivative. For example, a single             <br /> recombination event might generate two copies of the in-      <br /> sertion mutation and simultaneously promote conversion of          <br /> UAU1 to URA3 in one of the copies. Therefore, our rate                              <br /> estimates serve as an empirical guide, but we remain skeptical                <br /> that interchromosomal recombination is so frequent in C. al-                     <br /> bicans.                                                                <br />    Allelic triplications were detectable for all of the genes we             <br /> examined, and we are uncertain of their genetic structure. One                        <br /> simple possibility is that they result from trisomy for the re-                 <br /> spective chromosome, perhaps in conjunction with an overall     <br /> increase in ploidy. In support of this idea, we note that several                <br /> different selections yield monosomic and trisomic C. albicans                <br /> derivatives (12, 13, 27). A second possibility is that the tripli-             <br /> cations result from tandem duplication or translocation of a                           <br /> smaller genomic segment, a mechanism that also has exper-                          <br />                                                                                  <br /> imental support (11, 20, 25). The UAU1 cassette may be a                              <br /> useful tool to define the genetic and environmental parameters                      <br /> that influence changes in gene dosage through either of these                          <br /> mechanisms.                                                                        <br />   <br /> </body></html>
