Here we report the genetic and molecular <br />              characterization of mutations in cyclope (cype) and the cloning of the gene encoding a cytochrome c oxidase <br />              subunit VIc homolog. cype is an essential gene whose mutations are lethal and show pleiotropic phenotypes. <br />              The 77-amino acid peptide encoded by cype is 46% identical and 59% similar to the human subunit (75 <br />              amino acids). The transcripts are expressed maternally and throughout development in localized regions. <br />              They are found predominantly in the central nervous system of the embryo; in the central region of <br />              imaginal discs; in the germarium, follicular, and nurse cells of the ovary; and in testis. A search in the <br />              Genome Annotation Database of Drosophila revealed the absence of subunit VIIb and the presence of 9 <br />              putative nuclear cytochrome c oxidase subunits with high identity scores when compared to the 10 human <br />              subunits. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> C    YTOCHROME c oxidase (COX) is the terminal en- <br />       zyme in both the eukaryotic and prokaryotic respi- <br /> ratory chain complex that catalyzes the conversion of <br />                                                                             mitochondrial DNA and form the catalytic core.
