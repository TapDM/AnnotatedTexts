Homol- <br /> ogy searches of the yeast genome with known syntax- <br /> ins identified a novel gene (ORF YDR468c) of 676- <br /> nucleotide pairs potentially coding for a 225&#8211;amino <br /> acid protein with an estimated molecular mass of 25.8 <br /> kDa. A study on the ORF YDR468c was recently pub- <br /> lished by Holthuis et al. (1998a), and the protein was <br /> named Tlg1p. The coiled-coil domain of Tlg1p shows <br /> homology to other syntaxins, namely syntaxin-6 (28% <br /> identity and 58% similarity) and the SNAP-25 homo- <br /> logue Vam7p (21% identity and 51% similarity) (Wada <br /> and Anraku, 1992; Bock et al., 1996; Klumperman et al., <br /> 1998). In mammalian syntaxins, this conserved do- <br /> main acts as a site for the binding of a-SNAP, VAMP, <br /> and SNAP-25 to rat syntaxin 1A (Chapman et al., 1994; <br /> Kee et al., 1995). <br />  <br /> Tlg1p Is Essential for Cell Viability or Normal Cell <br /> Growth in Three Different Yeast Strains <br /> To determine whether the product of TLG1 is func- <br /> tional and required for protein transport, the TLG1 <br /> ORF was replaced with a functional 1.6 kb of the LEU2 <br /> gene (Figure 1A).

The presence of <br /> some p2CPY in tlg1-1 and tlg1-15 mutant cells at 38&#176;C <br /> after 60 min chase may be indicative of the slight <br /> leakiness in these mutants at 38&#176;C, because a dilution <br /> of Tlg1p in Dtlg1 cells accumulated the p1CPY and <br /> complete inhibition of growth (Figure 2). These results <br /> suggest that Tlg1p may function between ER to Golgi <br /> and/or cis- to medial- intra-Golgi transport but does <br /> not exclude its possible function in intraGolgi retro- <br /> grade events. <br />    To examine whether post-ER glycosyl modifications <br /> had occurred, we eluted the CPY immunoprecipitate <br /> of TLG1, tlg1-1, and tlg1-15 mutants by heating the <br /> samples at 90&#176;C for 15 min and diluted the superna- <br /> tant 10-fold with IP buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA. <br /> The samples were divided into two fractions and re- <br /> immunoprecipitated with antisera against the a-1,6- <br /> mannose linkages or antisera against CPY. a-1,6-Man- <br /> nose linkages are added at the cis- and medial-Golgi <br /> (Franzusoff and Schekman, 1989; Graham et al., 1994). <br /> The p2CPY and mCPY were immunoprecipitated with <br /> antisera against a-1,6-mannose (Figure 4B) as effi- <br /> ciently as those samples that were immunoprecipi- <br /> tated with anti-CPY antiserum. However, the p1CPY <br /> form from all samples was poorly detected, suggest- <br /> ing that the p1CPY was either not modified or poorly <br /> modified by a-1,6-mannose. Indeed in similar CPY <br /> immunoprecipitation experiments on vti1-24 cells that <br /> were incubated at 38&#176;C, Lupashin et al. (1997) obtained <br /> a similar result. Vti1p is an intra-Golgi retrograde <br /> v-SNARE protein, and vti1-24 mutant cells accumulate <br /> p1CPY at the restrictive temperature (Lupashin et al., <br /> 1997). <br />    To further test the effect of tlg1 ts mutations on         Figure 5.

The mature hyper- <br /> glycosylated forms of invertase secreted at 38&#176;C by <br /> wild-type cells (Figure 5B, lane 1&#8211;3) as well as the <br /> underglycosylated forms of invertase secreted at 38&#176;C <br /> by tlg1-15 (Figure 5B, lanes 4 &#8211; 6) and tlg1-24 (Figure <br /> 5B, lanes 7&#8211;9) cells were immunoprecipitated well by <br /> all three antibodies. Under similar experimental con- <br /> ditions, the core glycosylated form of invertase was <br /> immunoprecipitated only by anti-invertase antibodies <br /> but not by anti-a-1,6-mannose and anti-a-1,3-mannose <br /> linkage-specific antibodies (our unpublished results). <br /> These results suggest that the hypoglycosylated inver- <br /> tase secreted by the mutants at 38&#176;C was modified by <br /> both a-1,6-mannose and a-1,3-mannose enzymes (Fig- <br /> ure 5B, lane 4 &#8211;9).
