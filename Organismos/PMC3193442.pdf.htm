Endogenous <br /> Rap1GAP co-immunoprecipitated with RET in neural tissues, and RET and Rap1GAP were co-expressed in dop- <br /> aminergic neurons of the mesencephalon. In addition, overexpression of Rap1GAP attenuated GDNF-induced neu- <br /> rite outgrowth, whereas suppressing the expression of endogenous Rap1GAP by RNAi enhanced neurite outgrowth. <br /> Furthermore, using co-immunoprecipitation analyses, we found that the interaction between RET and Rap1GAP <br /> was enhanced following GDNF treatment. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that Tyr981 in the intracellular domain of <br /> RET was crucial for the interaction with Rap1GAP. Moreover, we found that Rap1GAP negatively regulated GNDF- <br /> induced ERK activation and neurite outgrowth. Taken together, our results suggest the involvement of a novel inter- <br /> action of RET with Rap1GAP in the regulation of GDNF-mediated neurite outgrowth. <br /> Keywords: GDNF; RET; Rap1GAP; neurite outgrowth; receptor tyrosine kinase; dopaminergic neurons; PC12 cells <br /> Cell Research (2011) 21: 327-337. doi:10.1038/cr.2010.139; published online 28 September 2010 <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> Introduction                                                                is required to induce branching of ureteric buds during <br />                                                                             kidney development [5] and is important for cell fate de- <br />    Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)                       cision of undifferentiated spermatogonia in the testis [6]. <br /> was originally discovered by its ability to promote the                     The significance of GDNF is underscored by its potent <br /> survival of midbrain dopaminergic neurons [1] but has                       neuroprotective and restorative effects in several animal <br /> since been demonstrated to be crucial for the survival                      models of Parkinson&#8217;s disease and motor neuron disease, <br /> and differentiation of many neuronal subpopulations,                        making it an attractive therapeutic candidate for treat- <br /> including motor neurons, sympathetic neurons, sensory                       ment of neurodegenerative diseases [7, 8]. <br /> neurons and enteric neurons [2-4].
