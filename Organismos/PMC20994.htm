Interestingly, <br /> unlike wild-type FtsY which migrates extremely slowly (ap- <br /> parent molecular weight 97 kDa compared with a calculated <br /> molecular weight of 54 kDa; Fig. 3C, lane 2; see also refs. 13 <br /> and 20), the migration of mutant D92 is only moderately slower <br /> (&apos;58 kDa) compared with a calculated molecular weight of 44 <br /> kDa and D198 migrates according to its calculated molecular <br /> weight (33 kDa). Therefore, the aberrant migration of FtsY in <br /> SDSyPAGE is determined by the N-terminal sequence. <br />    The observations that we have described lead to the con- <br /> clusion that the N-terminal domain of FtsY carries an essential <br /> function. One possibility referred to above is that this domain <br /> mediates membrane targeting and attachment of FtsY. To test <br /> this hypothesis we constructed hybrids between the N- <br /> terminally truncated FtsY mutants and unrelated integral <br /> membrane proteins which have the ability to guide and anchor <br /> the mutant proteins to the membrane. We used integral <br /> membrane polypeptides from the LacY of E. coli because it is <br /> well characterized structurally (21) and contains 12 hydropho- <br /> bic membrane spanning segments (Fig. 1D). The fusion joints, <br /> connecting N-terminal fragments of LacY with the FtsY <br /> mutants, were placed at known cytoplasmic locations accord- <br /> ing to the secondary structure of the permease which has been <br /> recently updated (22). Specifically, mutants D92 and D198 were <br /> fused to the cytoplasmic loops between transmembrane seg- <br /> ments 4 and 5 (to form N4-D92), and 6 and 7 (to form <br /> N6-D198), respectively (Fig. 1D).

These differences support a suggestion that the <br />                                             <br />  <br /> two proteins use different membrane targeting and attachment                <br /> mechanisms or recognize and interact with different integral                   <br /> membrane counterparts. In both cases, however, the SRP                      <br /> receptor is probably responsible for an essential step late                        <br /> during the targeting process, by placing the ribosome&#8211;nascent              <br />                                                                                    <br /> chain&#8211;SRP complex near the translocation machinery on the                   <br /> target membrane. An important challenge is to clarify the                         <br /> mechanism and to identify the proteins that mediate the                     <br /> following step in the targeting pathway where the translation                    <br /> machinery is transferred from the SRP system to the translo-                      <br /> cation apparatus.                                                            <br />                                                                              <br />   This work was supported by the Leo and <span id='am-56' about='obo:NCBITaxon_483972' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_33208 obo:NCBITaxon_33213 obo:NCBITaxon_71490 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_1206795 obo:NCBITaxon_216305 obo:NCBITaxon_483971 obo:NCBITaxon_216307 obo:NCBITaxon_158023 obo:NCBITaxon_977775 obo:NCBITaxon_6447 obo:NCBITaxon_33317 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_6448 obo:NCBITaxon_6072'><span id='am-57' property="rdfs:label" content="Julia" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-58' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-59' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Julia</span> Forchheimer Center                 <br /> for Molecular Genetics, the Weizmann Institute of Science, and the          <br /> Dr. Josef Cohn <span id='am-1' about='obo:NCBITaxon_491933' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_31345 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_2797 obo:NCBITaxon_29216 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_2763'><span id='am-2' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-3'  ></span><span id='am-4' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-5' property="rdfs:label" content="Minerva" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-6' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Minerva Nelson, 2005" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Minerva</span> Center for Biomembrane Research.                           <br /> </body></html>
