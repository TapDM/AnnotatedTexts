Here, we put ygjD under control of an inducible <br />   promoter, and used time-lapse microscopy and single cell analysis to investigate the phenotypic consequences of <br />   the depletion of YgjD protein from growing cells. <br />   Results: We show that loss of YgjD leads to a marked decrease in cell size and termination of cell division. The <br />   transition towards smaller size occurs in a controlled manner: cell elongation and cell division remain coupled, but <br />   cell size at division decreases. We also find evidence that depletion of YgjD leads to the synthesis of the <br />   intracellular signaling molecule (p)ppGpp, inducing a cellular reaction resembling the stringent response. <br />   Concomitant deletion of the relA and spoT genes - leading to a strain that is uncapable of synthesizing (p)ppGpp - <br />   abrogates the decrease in cell size, but does not prevent termination of cell division upon YgjD depletion. <br />   Conclusions: Depletion of YgjD protein from growing cells leads to a decrease in cell size that is contingent on <br />   (p)ppGpp, and to a termination of cell division. The combination of single-cell timelapse microscopy and statistical <br />   analysis can give detailed insights into the phenotypic consequences of the loss of essential genes, and can thus <br />   serve as a new tool to study the function of essential genes. <br />  <br />  <br /> Background                                                                            <span id='am-57' about='obo:NCBITaxon_4932' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_4930 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_4751 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_4893 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_451864 obo:NCBITaxon_4892 obo:NCBITaxon_4891 obo:NCBITaxon_4890 obo:NCBITaxon_716545 obo:NCBITaxon_147537 obo:NCBITaxon_2759'><span id='am-58' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccharomyces capensis" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-59' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Candida robusta" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-60' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccharomyes cerevisiae" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-61' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="brewer&apos;s yeast" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-62' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccharomyces uvarum var. melibiosus" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-63' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-64' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="lager beer yeast" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-65' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="yeast" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-66' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccaromyces cerevisiae" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-67' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccharomyces italicus" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-68' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-69' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Saccharomyces oviformis" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-70' property="rdfs:label" content="Saccharomyces cerevisiae" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-71'  ></span><span id='am-72' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Sccharomyces cerevisiae" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-73' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="baker&apos;s yeast" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> and <span id='am-123' about='obo:NCBITaxon_561' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_91347 obo:NCBITaxon_1224 obo:NCBITaxon_2 obo:NCBITaxon_543 obo:NCBITaxon_1236'><span id='am-124' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-125' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:11" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-126' property="rdfs:label" content="Escherichia" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-127'  ></span><span id='am-128' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Escherchia" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-129' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="PMID:19700542" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Escherichia</span> coli, respec- <br /> Genes that are highly conserved between different types                               tively) is required to add a threonyl carbamoyl adeno- <br /> of organisms code for important biological functions                                  sine (t6A) modification to a subset of tranfer-RNAs that <br /> and are therefore usually well studied and described.                                 recognize codons with an adenin at the first position. <br /> One group of conserved genes whose function has                                       Transfer-RNAs undergo complex modifications and <br /> remained enigmatic until recently is the Kae1(OSGEP)/                                 maturation steps [9] required for translational fidelity <br /> YgjD <span id='am-81' about='obo:NCBITaxon_family' typeof='owl:Thing NCBITaxon:_taxonomic_rank'><span id='am-82' property="rdfs:label" content="family" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-83' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span>family</span>.

In fact this <br /> and observed no decrease in cell size (Additional file 10                              is what we observed when we analyzed each generation <br /> - Figure S4, and Additional Files 11 and 12 - movies 7                                 of cells during the depletion process separately (inserts <br /> and 8).

We considered two pos-                                   related, because they derive from the same mother or <br /> sibilities.

A) The relationship between the <br />   cell elongation rate and the interval between two divisions during YgjD depletion (Movie 2, additional files), and B) for MG1655 (Movie 3, <br />   additional files). For YgjD depletion, cell elongation rate starts to decrease from generation 3 on. However, this decrease in cell elongation rate <br />   is initially not compensated for by an increase in the interval between two divisions. Points below the contour line correspond to cells that <br />   divide before they double in size, and whose size thus steadily declines. The inset lists the result of a non-parametric correlation analysis <br />   between &#8216;cell elongation rate&#8217; and &#8216;time to division&#8217;, performed separately for every generation. A negative correlation indicates coupling of the <br />   interval between division and the cell elongation rate. For MG1655, the majority of cells cluster around the contour line.
