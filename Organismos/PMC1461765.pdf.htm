It                             <br /> is possible, therefore, that loss of Css1p function causes a                      <br /> reduction in an unknown ceramide-anchored cell wall                  <br /> protein(s) whose function is to coordinate glucan syn-                       <br /> thesis and incorporation into the wall with cell growth                      <br /> (Figure 8, model B). Finally, our data do not exclude the                      <br /> possibility that Css1p acts on other lipid phosphodiesters                 <br /> lacking ceramide (Figure 8, model C). Because S. pombe                   <br /> Css1p has an essential function, further analysis of css1-                    <br />                                                                         <br /> interacting genes will provide a unique opportunity to                        <br /> probe the role of ceramides and other sphingolipid                         <br /> metabolites in yeast cell function.                                           <br /> </body></html>
