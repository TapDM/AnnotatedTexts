This was accomplished <br /> by tagging genomic ORC6 with a sequence encoding the GFP <br /> variant eYFP in a haploid yeast strain (DY-1), resulting in <br /> expression of full-length Orc6 with a C-terminal eYFP tag, <br /> under the control of the natural ORC6 promoter (DY-41). <br /> Studies with human cancer cells indicate that, in addition <br /> to the expected nuclear localization during interphase, cyto- <br /> plasmic pools of Orc6 exist with localization observed at both <br /> the cell periphery during mitosis and at the midbody during <br /> cytokinesis (Prasanth et al, 2002). Similar results have been <br /> reported for Drosophila cells (Chesnokov et al, 2003). When <br /> we followed single cells as they progressed through the cell <br /> cycle, only nuclear Orc6 localization was observed <br /> (Figure 1A). To confirm that S. cerevisiae Orc6 is confined <br /> to the nucleus, we constructed a double-tagged haploid strain <br /> expressing Orc6 with a C-terminal eCFP fusion as well as the <br /> nuclear pore protein Nup49 with a C-terminal eYFP fusion <br /> (DY-65). Irrespective of cell cycle stage, Orc6 was consistently <br /> bounded by the nuclear membrane, as designated by the <br /> signal for Nup49 (Figure 1C). Although we cannot rule out <br />                                                                    Figure 1 Orc6 localizes to subnuclear foci throughout the cell <br /> additional pools of Orc6 below our threshold of detection, we      cycle.

Finally, we tested the ORC <br /> subunits against Mcm10, which is required to preserve the <br /> interaction of Mcm2 with chromatin in G1 phase (Homesley <br /> et al, 2000). Here, we noticed a very similar pattern to that <br /> observed for Cdt1, with Orc6 again exhibiting the highest <br /> two-hybrid signal. Since both Cdt1 and Mcm10 interacted <br /> with Orc6, we evaluated the effect of G2/M Orc6 depletion on <br /> their chromatin association in G1. There was no appreciable <br /> effect on the degree chromatin binding of either protein <br /> (Figure 3B). <br />  <br /> Orc6 is required to maintain MCM chromatin <br /> association following pre-RC formation <br /> Studies with Xenopus egg extracts indicate that once the <br /> MCM proteins are assembled onto chromatin, ORC and <br /> Cdc6 can be removed without affecting their putative DNA <br /> helicase function (Hua and Newport, 1998; Rowles et al, <br /> 1999). Therefore, we were interested to determine whether <br /> Orc6 is still required for the efficient initiation of DNA <br /> replication after MCM proteins have been loaded onto chro- <br /> matin. This was carried out by synchronizing cultures of <br /> GAL1-ORC6 and its parental strain growing in YPG/R in late <br /> G1 phase by adding a-factor. Following the initial arrest, cells <br /> were transferred to YPD again with a-factor to deplete Orc6 <br /> in the GAL1-ORC6 strain. After release from the block, an <br /> accumulation of 1C cells was observed for the Orc6-depleted <br /> GAL1-ORC6 culture by 30 min, while the isogenic wt strain <br /> displayed a prominent 2C peak at the same time point, <br /> consistent with a role for Orc6 in S phase progression <br /> (Figure 4A).

An important              for how Orc6 facilitates MCM chromatin association were <br /> consideration in answering this question is that S. cerevisiae     suggested by our observations that Orc6 interacts with both <br /> Orc6 shares only low conservation with its Drosophila (5%          Cdt1 and Mcm10, two factors required for stable association <br /> identity, 19% similarity) and human (6% identity, 15%              of Mcm2 with chromatin (Homesley et al, 2000; Devault et al, <br /> similarity) orthologs. Furthermore, sequence comparison of         2002; Tanaka and Diffley, 2002). While there appeared to be <br /> Orc1&#8211;Orc6 from these species suggests that Orc6 evolved            no significant effect on the chromatin levels of either Cdt1 or <br /> more quickly than any of the other ORC subunits (Dhar and          Mcm10 following the G2/M Orc6 depletion, the chromatin <br /> Dutta, 2000). Thus, it appears that metazoan Orc6 has              pellet to supernatant ratio of Mcm10 dropped by approxi- <br /> conserved its original role in DNA replication, while acquir-      mately 50% when Orc6 expression was shut-off in late G1 <br /> ing cytokinetic and, at least in the case of human Orc6,           phase (Figure 4B, Supplementary Figure 3), again suggesting <br /> mitotic functions.

Cells were             <br /> harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS and the pellet was snap             <br /> frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  801C. Cell lysis was         <br /> performed with glass beads in 500 ml lysis buffer containing <br /> protease inhibitors. The soluble fraction of the whole-cell extract <br /> was discarded and the insoluble pellet was resuspended in 500 ml       <br /> lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. This extract was <br /> sonicated five times for 25 s at 5&#8211;6 W to achieve an average DNA     <br /> fragment size of 500 bp using a MicrosonTM XL 2000 (Misonix).           <br /> Samples were spun down twice for 2 min at 4500 g to remove cell         <br /> debris. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with 30 ml anti-goat        <br /> IgG agarose beads (Sigma, A9294), which were preincubated with          <br /> 2 mg each of anti-Mcm2 (Santa Cruz, sc-6680) and anti-Mcm5 (Santa       <br /> Cruz, sc-6686) antibodies.
