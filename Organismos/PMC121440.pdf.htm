As a component of the multisubunit CCR4 tran- <br />           scriptional complex, DBF2 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression. We have found that MOB1, an <br />           essential protein required for a late mitotic event in the cell cycle, genetically and physically interacts with <br />           DBF2. DBF2 binds MOB1 in vivo and can bind it in vitro in the absence of other yeast proteins. We found that <br />           the expression of MOB1 is also cell cycle regulated, its expression peaking slightly before that of DBF2 at the <br />           G2/M boundary. While overexpression of DBF2 suppressed phenotypes associated with mob1 temperature- <br />           sensitive alleles, it could not suppress a mob1 deletion. In contrast, overexpression of MOB1 suppressed pheno- <br />           types associated with a dbf2-deleted strain and suppressed the lethality associated with a dbf2 dbf20 double <br />           deletion. A mob1 temperature-sensitive allele with a dbf2 disruption was also found to be synthetically lethal. <br />           These results are consistent with DBF2 acting through MOB1 and aiding in its function. Moreover, the ability <br />           of temperature-sensitive mutated versions of the MOB1 protein to interact with DBF2 was severely reduced, <br />           confirming that binding of DBF2 to MOB1 is required for a late mitotic event. While MOB1 and DBF2 were <br />           found to be capable of physically associating in a complex that did not include CCR4, MOB1 did interact with <br />           other components of the CCR4 transcriptional complex. We discuss models concerning the role of DBF2 and <br />           MOB1 in controlling the telophase/G1 transition. <br />  <br />  <br />    In eukaryotic cells, many of the cell cycle stages are regulated            affect genes involved in cell wall integrity and under glucose <br /> by phosphorylation, and a number of protein kinases involved in                conditions are able to suppress enhanced ADH2 expression <br /> the cell cycle are known to date.
