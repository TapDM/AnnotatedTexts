We report here the identification of RSS1 (Rat Seven Suppressor) as a <br />         high-copy extragenic suppressor of the rat7-1 temperature-sensitive allele. Rsslp encodes <br />         a novel essential protein of 538 amino acids, which contains an extended predicted <br />         coiled-coil domain and is located both at nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and in the <br />         cytoplasm. RSS1 is the first reported high-copy extragenic suppressor of a mutant <br />         nucleoporin. Overexpression of Rsslp partially suppresses the defects in nucleocytoplas- <br />         mic export of poly(A)+ RNA, rRNA synthesis and processing, and nucleolar morphology <br />         seen in rat7-1 cells shifted to the nonpermissive temperature of 37&#176;C and, thus, restores <br />         these processes to levels adequate for growth at a rate approximately one-half that of <br />         wild-type cells. After a shift to 37&#176;C, the mutant Rat7-lp/Nupl59-lp is lost from the <br />         nuclear rim of rat7-1 cells and NPCs, which are clustered together in these cells grown <br />         under permissive conditions become substantially less clustered. Overexpression of <br />         Rsslp did not result in retention of the mutant Rat7-lp/Nupl59-lp in NPCs, but it did <br />         result in partial maintenance of the NPC-clustering phenotype seen in mutant cells. <br />         Depletion of Rsslp by placing the RSS1 open reading frame (ORF) under control of the <br />         GALl promoter led to cessation of growth and nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA <br />         without affecting nuclear protein import or nuclear pore complex distribution, suggest- <br />         ing that RSS1 is directly involved in mRNA export.

The <br />                                    graph suggests that the depletion of Rsslpmyc was <br />                                    achieved earlier than the depletion of wild-type <br />                                    Rsslp. This result indicates that myc-tagged Rsslp <br />                                    was less stable than wild-type Rsslp. To monitor the <br />                                    decrease in the levels of Rsslpmyc after cells were <br />                                    transferred to glucose, we performed a Western blot <br />                                    on extracts of cells grown on the repressing (glu- <br />                                    cose) medium for different periods of time (Figure <br />                                    liC). The figure shows that, within 2.5 h of growth <br />                                    on glucose, the level of the protein was reduced to <br />                                     -10% of its level in cells grown on galactose.

Cells were grown in galactose or <br />                                    transferred to glucose for 3, 6, 9, or 12 h (Figure 12A). <br />                                    When cells were grown on galactose, poly(A)+ RNA <br />                                    was evenly distributed throughout the cell (Figure <br />                                    12A, Oh), as is the case in wild-type cells. After the cells <br />                                    were grown for 3 h in glucose, no change in the <br />                                    distribution pattern was seen, but after 6 h in glucose, <br />                                    nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA was detect- <br />                                    able in -20-30% of the cells. After 9 h, the percentage <br />                                    of cells accumulating mRNA in their nuclei increased <br />                                    to -80%. After 12 h in glucose, essentially all cells <br />                                    showed nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA and a <br />                                    substantially reduced cytoplasmic signal. This result <br />                                    provides strong evidence that Rsslp is involved in <br />                                    mRNA export. <br />                                      Because the strain bearing the GALl-driven myc- <br />                                    tagged RSS1 plasmid ceased growth more rapidly <br />                                    after transfer to glucose-containing media than cells <br />                                    bearing the GALl-driven wild-type RSS1 plasmid, <br />                                    we tested whether this was reflected in a more rapid <br />                                    onset of the mRNA export defect by performing an <br />                                    in situ hybridization assay with the GALl-driven <br />                                    myc-tagged RSS1-containing strain.

In the absence of Rat7p/            <br /> Nupl59p, a subcomplex of the NPC that contains             <br /> Rat7p/Nupl59p either may not assemble or may not            <br /> be further assembled into NPCs. Perhaps Rsslp acts to         <br /> ensure that the other components of a putative Rat7p          <br /> subcomplex are retained in the pore when mutant              <br /> rat7-lp is lost after a shift to 37&#176;C. NPCs are known to     <br /> be attached to a nuclear envelope lattice in metazoan          <br /> cells (Maul, 1977; Goldberg and Allen, 1992; Ris and    <br /> Malecki, 1993), and there is evidence that a similar          <br /> attachment occurs in yeast cells (Allen and Douglas,         <br /> 1989). An association of NPCs with cytoskeletal ele-           <br /> ments has been observed in metazoan cells (Franke,           <br /> 1971; Jones et al., 1982), but there is no evidence yet for    <br /> similar associations in yeast cells. Because Rat7p/          <br /> Nupl59p is located on the cytoplasmic face of NPCs,        <br /> at a distance consistent with it being part of the cyto-      <br /> plasmic fibrils of the NPC, Rat7p/Nupl59p seems              <br /> more likely to be involved in interactions between           <br /> NPCs and cytoskeletal elements than with nucleoskel-      <br /> etal elements. Perhaps such interactions are essential    <br /> for proper transport of substrates through NPCs. If          <br /> critical connections between NPCs and cytoplasmic              <br /> structures were disrupted by mutation of the Rat7p/          <br /> Nupl59p nucleoporin, then export substrates might              <br /> be unable to exit from NPCs and associate with the       <br /> translation machinery. A significant fraction of polyri-       <br /> bosomes, mRNA, and factors required for protein syn-         <br /> thesis are associated with the actin cytoskeleton (Lenk      <br /> et al., 1977; <span id='am-62' about='obo:NCBITaxon_1162614' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_6073 obo:NCBITaxon_33208 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_6132 obo:NCBITaxon_723795 obo:NCBITaxon_6101 obo:NCBITaxon_40677 obo:NCBITaxon_723794 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_6072'><span id='am-63' property="rdfs:label" content="Cervera" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-64'  ></span><span id='am-65' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-66' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Cervera</span> et al., 1981; Yang et al., 1990;         <br /> Zambetti et al., 1990a,b; Hesketh and Pryme, 1991;         <br /> Hansen and Ingber, 1992). Therefore, there may be <br /> connections between the cytoskeleton and NPCs, and       <br /> mRNP exiting the pore may be actively transferred to          <br /> the actin cytoskeleton or to cytoskeleton-bound ribo-          <br /> somes. Perhaps high-copy Rsslp acts to maintain                <br /> these NPC-cytoskeletal interactions, thereby permit-          <br />  <br /> </body></html>
