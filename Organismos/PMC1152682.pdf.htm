The activity loss <br />              is accompanied by the modification of less than two arginine residues per subunit <br />              with no concomitant loss of Cu or Zn. The phenylglyoxal-modified enzymes require at <br />              least a 20-fold greater concentration of cyanide for 50% inhibition than do the <br />              corresponding native enzymes.

The remaining activity is truly a                  <br /> reflection of the modified enzyme, rather than              <br /> being due to residual native enzyme, in agreement        <br /> with Malinowski &amp; Fridovich (1979), Martin &amp;           <br /> Fridovich (1981) and Mota de Freitas &amp; Valentine              <br /> (1984).                                                     <br />    The phenylglyoxal-modified enzyme was at least          <br /> 20-fold more resistant to the inhibitory effect of             <br /> CN- than was the native enzyme. This may <br /> indicate that the active-site arginine residue            <br /> facilitates the binding of CN- to the active-site              <br /> Cu(II) ion, much as it does the approach of 02- to          <br /> that site. Arginine has often been identified as the         <br /> positively charged residue providing for the bind-          <br /> ing of anions to functional sites of enzymes and          <br /> other proteins (Riordan et al., 1977; Riordan,             <br /> 1979; Bjerrum et al., 1983), and such a role, vis-a-         <br /> vis 02-, has been proposed for the arginine residue      <br /> Vol. 230 <br /> </body></html>
