Further investigation <br />      found that when TRAPPC4 was depleted, activated ERK1/2 specifically decreased in the nucleus, which was accompanied <br />      with cell growth suppression and apoptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Overexpression of TRAPPC4 promoted cell <br />      viability and caused activated ERK1/2 to increase overall, but especially in the nucleus. TRAPPC4 was expressed more highly <br />      in the nucleus of CRC cells than in normal colonic epithelium or adenoma which corresponded with nuclear staining of <br />      pERK1/2. We demonstrate here that TRAPPC4 may regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis in CRC by interaction with ERK2 <br />      and subsequently phosphorylating ERK1/2 as well as modulating the subcellular location of pERK1/2 to activate the relevant <br />      signaling pathway. <br />  <br />  <br /> Introduction                                                                           C1,5,6a,6b,8,9) [5].

The speculated role of TRAPPC4-ERK2 interaction in CRC. Extracellular signals, such as PDGF, activate ERK cascades(RAS/RAF/MER/ <br /> ERK) through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and utimately regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. TRAPPC4 binds and activates ERK1/2 as well as <br /> participates in the nuclear transport of pERK1/2. When TRAPPC4 is depleted, less ERK1/2 is phosphorylated, and relatively more pERK1/2 remains in <br /> the cytoplasm, which leads to suppression of cell proliferation and apoptosis. When TRAPPC4 is overexpressed, more ERK1/2 is activated, and even <br /> more is transported into the nucleus, finally leading to increased cell growth. <br /> doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023262.g007 <br />  <br />  <br />        PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org                                                   9                            August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23262 <br />                                                                                                    TRAPPC4-ERK2 Interaction Plays a Role in CRC <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> Cell culture                                                               Kumamoto, Japan) per well (100 ml medium/well) for 1 h at <br />    The colon cancer-derived cell line SW1116 (purchased from the           37uC, 5% CO2.
