Highly connected hub <br />                  proteins, largely responsible for maintaining network connectivity, have been found to be much <br />                  more likely to be essential for yeast survival. <br />                  Results: Here we investigate the properties of weighted gene co-expression networks formed <br />                  from multiple microarray datasets.
