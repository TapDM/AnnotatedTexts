Thus, the finding suggests a novel therapeutic strategy for prostatic cancer based on <br />                                 inhibiting Cks1 and Cks2 activity. <br />  <br />  <br />                            Introduction <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             The human Cks (also designated as CksHs) family consists of two well-conserved members, <br />                                             Cks1 and Cks2, both of which are identified based on the sequence homology to yeast suc1 <br />                                             and Cks1 (Cdc28 kinase subunit 1) that are essential for cell cycle control 1-3. Emerging <br />                                             evidence shows that the two Cks members in mammalian cells have distinct regulatory <br />                                             function from the yeast counterparts. Cks1 is required for SCFSkp2-mediated ubiquitination <br />                                             and degradation of p27kip1, which is essential for the G1/S transition during the cell cycle 4, <br />                                             5. Although function of Cks2 in the cell cycle is not clear, expression of both Cks1 and Cks2 <br />                                             has been shown oscillates during the cell cycle and is positively related to cell proliferation <br />                                             6. Recently, Cks2 has been shown essential for the first metaphase/anaphase transition of <br />                                             mammalian meiosis 7. <br />  <br />                                             Numerous reports demonstrate that expression of Cks2 is frequently elevated in tumors of <br />                                             different tissue origins, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, melanocytic tumors, Wilms <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                            Correspondence: Fen Wang, Center for Cancer and Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&amp;M Health <br />                            Science Center, 2121 W.

Knockdown of Cks1 inhibits growth and <br />                                          tumorigenicity of oral squamous cells 23. Consistent with the finding that Cks1 is a negative <br />                                          regulator of a cell cycle control protein, p27kip1, elevated expression of Cks1 is found <br />                                          coincident with the reduction of p27kip1 proteins in tumor cells.

Cancers arising <br />                                          from the prostate epithelium are the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most <br />                                          common cause of cancer death in American males. In America alone, about 230 thousand <br />                                          new cases and 30 thousand deaths are expected every year. To date, whether the Cks family <br />                                          is overexpressed in prostate tumor, and if yes, whether aberrantly expressed Cks contributes <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                          to prostate tumor initiation and progression remain to be characterized. Recently, it has been <br />                                          shown that Cks1 expression is associated with the aggressive behavior of prostate cancer 25. <br />                                          In addition, treating LNCaP prostate cancer cells with an herbal mixture, PC-SPES, inhibits <br />                                          cell proliferation and reduces expression of Cks2 26. <br />  <br />                                          To determine whether overexpression of the Cks family was associated with prostate <br />                                          tumorigenesis, we analyzed the expression pattern of Cks1 and Cks2 in the Dunning prostate <br />                                          tumor model of rats, the TRAMP prostate cancer model of mice, human prostate cancer cell <br />                                          lines, and human prostate cancer samples. The results showed that in comparison with <br />                                          normal prostate tissues that only weakly express Cks1 and Cks2, all tested human, rat, and <br />                                          mouse prostate tumor tissues and cells exhibited elevated expression of Cks1 and Cks2. <br />                                          Forced expression of Cks1 and Cks2 by transfection in benign prostate tumor cells <br />                                          somewhat promoted cell population increases. Consistently, knockdown of Cks1 and Cks2 <br />                                          expression by shRNA in malignant AT3 cells inhibited cell population growth. In addition, <br />                                          knockdown of Cks1 expression also inhibited anchorage-independent growth, and migration <br />                                          activities, and knockdown of Cks2 expression induced the cells to undergo massive program <br />                                          cell death, especially when the cells were maintained in suboptimal growth condition. The <br />                                          results suggested that elevated expressed Cks1 may contribute to prostate tumorigenesis by <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                          promoting proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and migration of the cells, and <br />                                          Cks2 by protecting cells from undergoing programmed cell death. The finding also provides <br />                                          new hints for cancer therapeutic strategies based on inhibition of the Cks activity. <br />  <br />                                Experimental Procedures <br />                                Animals <br />                                          All animals were housed in the Program of Animal Resources at the Institute of Biosciences <br />                                          and Technology and were handled in accordance with the principles and procedures of the <br />                                          Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Strong Cks2 expression was evident in benign DT3 <br />                                            and malignant AT tumors, as well as in cell lines derived from both tumors, including the <br />                                            DTE epithelial and DTS stromal cells derived from benign DT tumors, and AT3 cells from <br />                                            the malignant AT tumors (Fig. 1Aa). To determine whether Cks1 and Cks2 were <br />                                            overexpressed in other prostate tumors, RT-PCR (30 cycles) was employed to assess Cks1 <br />                                            and Cks2 expression in the TRAMP autochthonous mouse prostate tumor model 28. <br />                                            Expression of Cks1 and Cks2 was apparent in TRAMP tumor tissues and the C2 cells <br />                                            derived from TRAMP tumors. Under the same condition, Cks expression was undetectable <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            in adult mouse prostates (Fig. 1Ab). <br />  <br />                                            To investigate whether aberrant expression of Cks1 and Cks2 was associated with human <br />                                            prostate cancers, RT-PCR analyses were employed to assess the expression of Cks1 and <br />                                            Cks2 in human prostate cell lines, including nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line <br />                                            PNTIA, low tumorigenic LNCaP, and highly tumorigenic DU-145 and PC3 cells (Fig 1Ac). <br />                                            The results showed that expression of Cks1 and Cks2 mRNA was evident in all tested cell <br />                                            lines, including the T antigen-immortalized human prostate epithelial cells isolated from the <br />                                            normal prostate tissues adjacent to prostate tumors. <br />  <br />                                            Furthermore, real-time RT-PCR analyses of cDNAs prepared from human prostate cancer <br />                                            and its peripheral normal tissues showed that a significant number of the tested tumors <br />                                            expressed Cks2 at a higher level than did the controls. Overall, relative to normal peripheral <br />                                            tissues, elevated expression of Cks2 was apparent in the tumor tissues (p&lt;0.01), whereas the <br />                                            difference in Cks1 expression was not statistically significant between the tumor and normal <br />                                            peripheral zone tissues (Fig. 1B and data not shown). In situ hybridization also demonstrated <br />                                            that expression of Cks2 was evident in lesion foci with high-grade prostate intraepithelial <br />                                            neoplasia (PIN) in human prostate (Fig. 1Ca), whereas no Cks2 expression was detectable in <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            the epithelium with normal tissue histology (Fig. 1Cb). To further investigate whether <br />                                            aberrant expression of Cks was associated with prostate tumorigenesis, prostate tissues were <br />                                            harvested from TRAMP mice and wildtype littermates at the age of 4-8 weeks. Tissue <br />                                            sections with relatively normal tissue structures, low to medium grade PIN, high grade PIN, <br />                                            and adenocarcinomas were selected for in situ hybridization analyses (Fig. 1D). The results <br />                                            confirmed that Cks1 and Cks2 expression in normal prostate was under the detection limit <br />                                            (panels a,b). The expression of Cks was also very low in foci with low grade PIN lesions <br />                                            (data not shown), whereas the expression was apparent in tissues with lesions of high grade <br />                                            PIN (panels c and d, arrows), and adenocarcinomas (panels e and f, arrows). <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                Int J Cancer.

Real- <br />                                           time RT-PCR analyses revealed that expression of Cks1 and Cks2 in the cells was reduced <br />                                           to about 25% and 35% of the original levels in the presence of doxycycline inducers. To <br />                                           determine whether knockdown of Cks1 or Cks2 expression inhibited cell growth, population <br />                                           curves of the cells cultured in normal media containing 5% FBS were measured with and <br />                                           without the induction of Cks1- and Cks2-shRNA expression. The results showed that Cks1 <br />                                           knockdown (Fig. 2A) reduced the population growth rate of the cells. Under the same <br />                                           condition, doxycycline treatment did not affect the growth rate of cells expressing stochastic <br />                                           shRNA and Cks2 shRNA (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Yet, when the cells were cultured in <br />                                           suboptimal media, including low serum concentration (data not shown) or containing 50% <br />                                           medium conditioned by AT3 cells (Fig. 2A), the population doubling rate was apparently <br />                                           reduced by expression of Cks2-shRNA. Western analyses demonstrated that the protein <br />                                           abundance of p27kip1 was elevated in Cks1, but not Cks2, knockdown cells (Fig. 2B), which <br />                                           was consistent with the finding that Cks1 triggers degradation of p27kip1. The results suggest <br />                                           Cks2 may be critical for cells to grow or survive in non-optimal conditions. Comparable to <br />                                           the cells expressing GFP alone or untransfected cells, DTE cells expressing either Cks1- or <br />                                           Cks2-GFP fusion proteins exhibited an accelerated population growth activity (Fig. 2C). <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           Interestingly, only the cells overexpressing Cks1, but not Cks2, had reduced p27kip1 <br />                                           abundance, which is a negative regulator of cell cycle progression (Fig. 2D). The results <br />                                           suggest that overexpressed Cks1 accelerates the population growth by directly promoting <br />                                           p27kip1 degradation and Cks2 by other mechanisms. <br />  <br />                                Knockdown of expression of Cks2 induces programmed cell death <br />                                           To further investigate the role of elevated expressed Cks1 or Cks2 in prostate tumor cells, <br />                                           the colony formation activity of AT3 cells stably transfected with the inducible shRNA <br />                                           constructs were assessed. It was apparent that the colony numbers were reduced by <br />                                           knockdown of Cks1 (Fig 3A), suggesting that elevated expression of Cks1 in malignant AT3 <br />                                           cells contributed to the anchorage-independent growth activity. In contrast, knockdown of <br />                                           Cks2 expression only slightly reduced the colony number, suggestive that Cks2 might not be <br />                                           essential for the anchorage-independent growth activity. Furthermore, cell migration assay <br />                                           showed that knocking down Cks1, but not Cks2, expression in AT3 cells significantly <br />                                           reduced cell migration activity (Fig. 3B). Separated experiments revealed that force <br />                                           expression of Cks1 and Cks2 to benign DTE cells did not affect the anchorage-independent <br />                                           growth and cell migration activities (data not shown). <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           Although knockdown of Cks2 expression did not severely inhibit migration and anchorage- <br />                                           independent growth in AT3 cells, it induced dramatic cell morphology change within 12 <br />                                           hours after the induction especially when the cells were cultured in a suboptimal culture <br />                                           medium that contained 50% of fresh medium and 50% of conditioned media. Most cells <br />                                           became rounded and loosely attached to the culture surface (Fig. 3C,D), suggestive of <br />                                           programmed cell death.

The results <br />                                           showed that knockdown of Cks2 expression induced significant cell death within 12 hours <br />                                           (Fig. 4A). In contrast, knockdown of Cks1 expression did not induce apoptosis under the <br />                                           same condition. Consistently, knockdown of Cks2 expression increased the caspase 3 <br />                                           activity by at least 2 folds (Fig. 4B).

To monitor the transfected cells, the GFP was <br />                                            coexpressed in the cells. Since about 85% of the transfectants are cotransfected with more <br />                                            than one vector, the majority of the GFP expressing cells would also express Cks2 shRNA. <br />                                            If knocking down Cks2 expression induced apoptosis in C2 cells, the majority of GFP <br />                                            positive cells would undergo apoptosis. The cells were stained with Cy3 conjugated <br />                                            Annexin V that recognized phosphatidylserine exposed only in apoptotic cell surface. <br />                                            Fluorescent microscopy analyses showed that, indeed, at 48 hours after the transfection, <br />                                            about 80% of GFP-positive cells were stained with Annexin V-Cy3, suggestive of the <br />                                            programmed cell death (Fig. 5). It is noticeable that not every GFP positive cells underwent <br />                                            apoptosis, and not every apoptotic cells expressed GFP, which reflects the fact that not every <br />                                            GFP positive cells also expressed Cks2 shRNA, and vice versa. In contrast, coexpression of <br />                                            stochastic shRNA and GFP or GFP alone rarely induced apoptosis in cells (Fig. 5). <br />                                            Similarly, knockdown of Cks2 expression also induced apoptosis in human DU145 cells <br />                                            (data not shown). Thus, the results further suggest a role of aberrantly expressed Cks2 in <br />                                            protecting prostate cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                Knockdown of Cks2 expression inhibits tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells <br />                                            The data that elevated Cks2 expression protected the cells from undergoing programmed <br />                                            cell death prompted us to investigate whether knockdown of Cks2 expression inhibited <br />                                            tumorigenicity of the cells. TRAMP C2 cells stably transfected with the inducible Cks2- <br />                                            shRNA construct were implanted to synergetic C57 mice as described 33. Doxycycline was <br />                                            administrated through drinking water to induce expression of Cks2-shRNA. As expected, <br />                                            the control cells gave rise to tumors within 2-3 weeks and caused the death of host animals <br />                                            by the time of 30-45 days. In sharp contrast, only 14% animals implanted with the cells <br />                                            expressing Cks2-shRNA died by the time of 55 days (Fig. 6A). The results were confirmed <br />                                            by separated experiments with another individual clone. It is noticeable that the Cks2- <br />                                            shRNA transfectants were less tumorigenic than the control even in the absence of <br />                                            doxycycline inducers. RT-PCR analyses revealed that expression of Cks2 in the two <br />                                            individual transfectants was somewhat lower than the cells expressing stochastic shRNA <br />                                            even in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 6B), suggestive of leaky expression of Cks2 <br />                                            shRNA. Thus, the reduction in Cks2 expression may inhibit tumorigenesis of the cells in the <br />                                            absence of doxycycline inducer. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                Discussion <br />                                            Here we demonstrate that expression of Cks1 and Cks2 was elevated in prostate tumors, <br />                                            including the Dunning prostate tumors in rat, the TRAMP tumors in mouse, and more <br />                                            importantly, in human prostate tumors and cell lines. Forced expression of Cks1 and Cks2 in <br />                                            benign prostate tumor epithelial cells accelerated cell growth; knockdown of Cks1 and Cks2 <br />                                            malignant prostate tumor cells inhibited cell growth, anchorage-independent growth, and <br />                                            migration activity. In addition, knockdown of Cks2 expression induced apoptosis in vitro <br />                                            and compromised tumorigenic activity of the cells in vivo. The results suggest that elevated <br />                                            expression of Cks1 may contribute to tumorigenicity of prostate tumor cells by promoting <br />                                            cell growth and elevated expression of Cks2 by protecting the cells from undergoing <br />                                            apoptosis. <br />  <br />                                            The function of the Cks family appears to be complicated. In yeast, both Cks1 and Cks2 <br />                                            bind to Cdk1 at a high affinity and function as a suppressor of Cdk1 mutants 1, 3, 34. <br />  <br />  <br />                                                Int J Cancer.

Page 8 <br />  <br />  <br />                                         Despite the high sequence homology between the two members, whether Cks1 and Cks2 in <br />                                         mammalian cells elicit redundant or synergistic activities is not well understood although <br />                                         one report demonstrates that Cks1 compensates for Cks2 loss of function in the germ line 7. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         In mammalian cells, Cks1 induces an allosteric change in Skp2, which increases its affinity <br />                                         for phosphorylated p27kip1 and triggers ubiquitination of p27kip1, resulting in a rapid <br />                                         proteasome-mediated degradation of p27kip1 during G1/S transition in the cell cycle. To <br />                                         date, decreases in p27kip1 expression or mutations of p27kip1 has been reported in tumors of <br />                                         many tissue origins, including prostate cancer 35, 36. Here we showed that forced <br />                                         expression of Cks1 reduced p27kip1 in the cells and accelerated cell growth, while <br />                                         knockdown Cks1 expression in malignant AT3 cells inhibited proliferation and increased <br />                                         p27kip1 abundance (Fig. 2). <br />  <br />                                         In addition to being a mitotic inhibitor, p27kip1 also has cell cycle-independent function, <br />                                         including regulating cell migration. However, p27kip1 has been shown both promoting and <br />                                         inhibiting cell migration 37-42. Recently, it has been showed that the binding of p27kip1 to <br />                                         the microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin regulates the activity of p27kip1 to repress cell <br />                                         migration. Upregulation of p27kip1 or downregulation of stathmin expression results in <br />                                         inhibition of cell motility that is essential for invasion and metastasis of tumors 43, 44. Our <br />                                         data showed that knockdown of Cks1 expression increased p27kip1 abundance in the cells <br />                                         and inhibited cell migration, which was consistent with the finding that p27kip1 inhibits <br />                                         migration and invasion of tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of p27kip1 in LNCaP cells <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         significantly increases colony formation in soft agar, suggesting that p27kip1 inhibits <br />                                         anchorage-independent growth activity of prostate cancer cells 45. Consistently, our data <br />                                         showed that knockdown of Cks1 expression increased abundance of p27kip1 and inhibited <br />                                         colony formation activity of the malignant AT3 cells. The result further suggests that <br />                                         overexpression of Cks1 might contribute to the tumorigenicity through promoting <br />                                         anchorage-independent growth activity. <br />  <br />                                         In contrast to Cks1, knockdown of Cks2 expression in AT3 cells did not increase p27kip1 <br />                                         abundance. Instead, it slightly reduced the abundance of p27kip1. It is possible that the <br />                                         reduction of p27kip1 abundance in AT3 cells was a result of cell death caused by knockdown <br />                                         of Cks2 expression (Fig. 2). Further experiments are needed to address the issue. Similarly, <br />                                         forced expression of Cks2 did not reduce p27kip1 albeit it accelerated DTE cell growth (Fig. <br />                                         2). Therefore, although changes in Cks2 expression affect cell growth and has been shown <br />                                         to oscillate during the cell cycle 6, it is likely that Cks2 may not directly control the cell <br />                                         cycle progression. Indeed, expression of Cks2 in DU145, AT3, and TRAMP C2 cells was <br />                                         not reduced when the cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 48 hours (Supplemental <br />                                         Fig. 1), in which condition, the cell proliferation was relatively lower than in full culture <br />                                         medium. It is possible that changes in Cks2 expression may impact cell growth by <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         preventing apoptosis. Both cell growth and apoptosis assays showed that knockdown of <br />                                         Cks2 expression in malignant AT3 cells had a more potent impact in cells maintained in <br />                                         non-optimal culture conditions than in those maintained in optimal condition. This may <br />                                         explain why the leaky expression of Cks2 shRNA had limited effects on stock cell cultures <br />                                         that were maintained in the optimal conditions, yet, had significant effects on in vivo <br />                                         tumorigenesis analyses where the cells were implanted subcutaneously and did not have <br />                                         optimal supplies of oxygen and nutrition. <br />  <br />                                         Together with the fact that Cks2 null mice did not have apparent defect in all tissues except <br />                                         the testes 7, our data here imply that Cks2 may not be essential for growth, differentiation, <br />                                         and maintenance of normal prostatic cells, yet, is essential for protecting the cells from <br />                                         undergoing apoptosis in harsh growth conditions, such as deficient in nutritional or oxygen <br />                                         supplies. Thus, inhibition of Cks2 activity may be of therapeutic potential for tumor <br />                                         treatment, and promotion of Cks2 activity may be useful for preventing cells to undergo <br />  <br />  <br />                                             Int J Cancer.

In addition, although having distinct roles, the two Cks members may <br />                                         synergistically contributed to prostate tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation and <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         preventing apoptosis. <br />  <br />                                         In summary, here we report that aberrant expression of Cks1 in prostate tumor cells <br />                                         promoted tumorigenicity by promoting proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and <br />                                         cellular migration activity, while aberrant expression of Cks2 may promote the <br />                                         tumorigenicity by protecting the cells from apoptosis. Together with the reports that Cks1 <br />                                         and Cks2 are not essential for somatic cell growth and tissue homeostasis, the results here <br />                                         suggest a novel strategy for prostatic cancer treatment without affecting normal somatic <br />                                         cells. <br />  <br />  <br />                                         A.
