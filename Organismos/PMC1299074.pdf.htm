After three PBS washings, the pellet was                      <br /> incubated with 200 ml of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse anti- <br />                                                                               <br /> body (Sigma) diluted 1:50 in PBS plus 1% NGS. For DNA                       <br /> quantification, cells were finally resuspended in 2 ml of PI solution              <br /> containing 2 mg/ml PI in PBS and 25 ml of RNase 1 mg/ml in water,                  <br /> and stained overnight at 4 1C in the dark. Samples were acquired              <br /> on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer. At least                          <br /> 10,000 events were acquired. Analysis was performed using                      <br /> CellQuest 3.3 (Becton Dickinson).                                                     <br /> Supplementary information is available at EMBO reports online                       <br /> </body></html>
