This information provides a glimpse             results). <br />  <br />  <br />    These issues may also be relevant to our studies involving           <br /> Cak1p&#8217;s role in activating the Smk1p MAPK pathway (see              <br /> model in Fig. 8). Similar to our analysis with Ime2p, we have         <br /> shown that Cak1p functions upstream of Smk1p (27). The <br /> activation loops of Ime2p and Smk1p contain a TXY motif.                                                <br /> Dual phosphorylation of the T and Y in Smk1p appears to be             <br /> required for full catalytic activity (27). Our data suggest that       <br />                                                                          <br /> dual phosphorylation is also required for full Ime2p activation.      <br /> Whether there is a common Cak1p-activated kinase that reg-               <br /> ulates both Ime2p and Smk1p remains to be determined.                  <br />    In addition to its roles in activating Ime2p and Smk1p,               <br /> Cak1p is required to activate Cdc28p during meiosis (see               <br /> model in Fig. 8). In mitosis, the activation of Cdc28p by Cak1p           <br /> appears to be largely unregulated, because large pools of             <br /> Cdc28p phosphorylated on T169 are present throughout the                 <br /> cell cycle (26). We found that the level of phosphorylated            <br /> Cdc28p is relatively constant throughout meiosis (Fig. 7).               <br /> These data suggest that while Cak1p-activated Cdc28p is re-              <br /> quired for meiosis (active Cdc28p is required at both the S and           <br /> M phases), the modification is constitutive and does not play a          <br /> direct role in regulating meiotic progression.                        <br />    Based upon sequence homology, Ime2p has been classified                <br /> as a Cdk-like kinase, yet no cyclin binding partner has been              <br /> identified to date. Similar to the roles Cdks play in the cell          <br /> cycle, Ime2p regulates multiple steps throughout meiosis.         <br /> These steps include initiating meiotic S phase as well as the            <br /> nuclear divisions. We and others have shown that Ime2p can be            <br /> electrophoretically resolved into a series of distinct phospho-          <br /> forms whose relative abundance changes during meiotic pro-           <br /> gression (1, 34). We speculate that the sequential phosphory-            <br /> lation of Ime2p represents a modification pathway that is            <br /> critical for the orderly progression through and successful com-      <br /> pletion of sporulation. These modifications could alter Ime2p&#8217;s          <br /> catalytic potency, substrate specificity, protein-protein interac-   <br /> tions, or cellular localization. We have shown here that muta-       <br /> tion of the tyrosine to a nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine              <br /> modestly reduces Ime2p&#8217;s potency for autophosphorylation                 <br /> and dramatically reduces its ability to phosphorylate Ndt80p in         <br /> vitro. It is less clear why Ime2p-T242A-myc behaves like a                <br /> catalytically inactive protein in vitro but is only modestly af-     <br /> fected in vivo. These data suggest that there may be complex         <br /> interactions between T and Y phosphorylation events in acti-             <br /> vating the Ime2p kinase. Remarkably, Ime2p is completely                 <br /> unmodified, even at late time points, in cells lacking CAK1.             <br /> These data suggest that Cak1p-dependent modification of     <br />                                                                      <br /> Ime2p&#8217;s activation loop is required for all subsequent phos-             <br /> phorylation events of Ime2p.

These data      <br /> suggest that Cak1p initiates the Ime2p phospho-modification              <br /> pathway and that autophosphorylation plays an essential role         <br /> in its progression.                                                      <br /> </body></html>
