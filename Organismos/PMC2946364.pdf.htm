When exposed to ER <br />    Since the majority of secretory proteins, such as antibodies,                       stress, via trans-autophosphorylation and activation of its RNase <br /> digestive enzymes, and hormones, are synthesized in the cytoplasm                      domain, IRE1 induces unconventional splicing of an mRNA <br /> and are cotranslationally translocated into the lumen of the                           encoding a specific transcription factor responsible for UPR <br /> endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a narrow channel called                             activation [4&#8211;8]. IRE1 is highly conserved from yeast to humans, <br /> translocon on the ER membrane, they are initially located in the                       and two IRE1 paralogues have been reported in mammals: IRE1a <br /> ER as unfolded and unmodified nascent polypeptides. These                              and IRE1b [9&#8211;11]. Specifically, IRE1a induces the unconven- <br /> proteins then undergo meticulous folding by molecular chaper-                          tional splicing of XBP1 mRNA under ER stress condition [12]. <br /> ones, correct disulfide bond formation by protein disulfide                            The spliced XBP1 mRNA is then translated into a functional <br /> isomerases, and proper oligosaccharide modification by the                             transcription factor to induce UPR. Besides IRE1, two ER-located <br /> oligosaccharyltransferase complex, sugar trimming enzymes, and                         transmembrane proteins, PERK and ATF6, play important roles <br /> calnexin/calreticulin cycle in the ER [1,2]. Therefore, when cells                     in mammalian UPR [13,14]. On sensing ER stress, PERK induces <br /> produce these proteins in large amounts, the ER is thought to be                       the phosphorylation of eIF2a and the translational activation of <br /> liable to become overloaded for the maturation of these proteins.

To adaptively respond to ER stress, the cell induces the                       domain is translocated to the nucleus [16,17]. Both ATF4 and the <br /> transcriptional activation of molecules for the maturation of                          cleaved ATF6 work as transcription factors in UPR induction, as <br /> proteins in the ER. This response is called unfolded protein                           well as XBP1 which is activated by IRE1a. <br /> response (UPR) [3]. Thus, UPR is an important cellular response                           As described above, IRE1a directly catalyzes the cleavage of <br /> for the mass production of functional secretory proteins from                          XBP1 mRNA in the splicing reaction under ER stress condition <br /> unfolded proteins in cells which produce them in large amounts.
