Herein, we report the cloning and charac- <br />         terization of the second largest subunit of Pol &#9280; in fission yeast, called Dpb2. We demonstrate that <br />         Dpb2 is essential for cell viability and that a temperature-sensitive mutant of dpb2 arrests with a <br />         1C DNA content, suggesting that Dpb2 is required for initiation of DNA replication. Using a <br />         chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we show that Dpb2, binds preferentially to origin DNA at <br />         the beginning of S phase. We also show that the C terminus of Pol &#9280; associates with origin DNA <br />         at the same time as Dpb2. We conclude that Dpb2 is an essential protein required for an early step <br />         in DNA replication. We propose that the primary function of Dpb2 is to facilitate assembly of the <br />         replicative complex at the start of S phase. These conclusions are based on the novel cell cycle <br />         arrest phenotype of the dpb2 mutant, on the previously uncharacterized binding of Dpb2 to <br />         replication origins, and on the observation that the essential function of Pol &#9280; is not dependent on <br />         its DNA synthesis activity. <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                             A second processive DNA polymerase, Pol &#9280;, is re- <br />                                                                       quired for cell viability and chromosomal DNA replica- <br /> Chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotic cells requires              tion in both fission (D&#8217;Urso and Nurse, 1997) and budding <br /> the activity of at least three DNA polymerases: &#9251;, &#9254;, and &#9280;           yeast (Morrison et al., 1990; Araki et al., 1992; Budd and <br /> (Waga and Stillman, 1998; Hubscher et al., 2000; Bell and             Campbell, 1993).

We speculate that this function might be related to T <br />                                                                              antigen&#8217;s ability to recruit Pol &#9251;/primase and possibly other <br />                                                                              factors to DNA. Therefore, the association of Pol &#9280; and Dpb2 to <br />                                                                              ARS-associated chromatin might represent a key step in the <br />                                                                              assembly of the replication initiation complex. <br />  <br />   <br /> Figure 6. Dpb2 fails to associate with origin DNA in cdc10-129 cells <br /> at 36&#176;C. (A) Exponentially growing 972 cells (lane 1), G2 arrested          <br /> GD254 cells (lane 2), or G1 arrested GD261 cells (lanes 3 and 4) were         <br /> subjected to ChIP analysis for the presence of chromatin bound Dpb2.         <br /> Either magnetic beads conjugated to anti-FLAG antibodies (lanes 1, 2 <br />                                                                              <br /> and 4) or magnetic beads alone (lane 3) were used for immunoprecipi- <br />                                                                               <br /> tation. The relative ratio of immunoprecipitated DNA to total DNA <br /> was plotted. No enrichment of Dpb2 binding to ars2004 is observed in         <br /> cdc10-129 cells arrested in G1 (lane 4). The levels of binding to either      <br /> non-ARS or ARS-associated chromatin in cdc10 cells is equivalent to       <br /> the level detected in either G2 arrested (lane 2) or exponentially grow-   <br /> ing cells (lane 1). Very little chromatin is precipitated from cdc10 cells   <br /> in the absence of antibodies (lane 3).

Second, human Pol &#9280; p17, a                     <br /> homolog of the Pol &#9280; subunit Dpb4, has been found as a                       <br /> component of human chromatin accessibility complex (CH-                      <br /> RAC), a chromatin-remodeling factor (Poot et al., 2000). <br />                                                                             <br />    Finally, our analysis of Pol &#9280; function in fission yeast may              <br /> provide an explanation for why Pol &#9280; is dispensable for SV40                <br /> viral DNA replication. In the case of SV40, the virus encodes its            <br /> own initiator protein, called T antigen. T antigen has multiple <br />                                                                             <br /> roles in promoting DNA replication, including site directed <br />                                                                              <br /> binding to the origin, ATP-dependent unwinding of DNA <br /> strands, and recruitment of DNA polymerase &#9251;/primase and                   <br /> possibly topoisomerase I to the site of initiation (Fanning, 1992;            <br /> Fanning and Knippers, 1992; Simmons et al., 1996). Perhaps                   <br /> similar to the function of the origin recognition complex (ORC)             <br /> and mini-chromosome maintenance complexes (MCMs), the                       <br /> essential nonreplicative function of Pol &#9280; is provided by T                <br /> antigen, and therefore is not required for viral DNA replica-               <br /> </body></html>
