SUI1 is an essential protein of 12.3 kDa that is required in vivo for the initiation of protein synthesis. <br />           Here we present evidence that SUI1 is identical to the smallest subunit, p16, of eukaryotic translation initiation <br />           factor 3 (eIF3) in S. cerevisiae. SUI1 and eIF3-p16 comigrate upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel <br />           electrophoresis and cross-react with anti-SUI1 and anti-eIF3 antisera. Anti-SUI1 antisera immunoprecipitate <br />           all of the subunits of eIF3, whereas antisera against the eIF3 complex and the individual PRT1 and GCD10 <br />           subunits of eIF3 immunoprecipitate SUI1. Finally, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of a truncated form of <br />           eIF3-p16 matches the sequence of SUI1. eIF3 isolated from a sui1ts strain at 37&amp;C lacks SUI1 and fails to exhibit <br />           eIF3 activity in the in vitro assay for methionyl-puromycin synthesis. A free form of SUI1 separate from the <br />           eIF3 complex is found in S. cerevisiae but lacks activity in the in vitro assay. The results, together with prior <br />           genetic experiments, indicate that SUI1 is essential for eIF3 activity and functions as part of eIF3 and in <br />           concert with eIF2 to promote eIF2&#8211;GTP&#8211;Met-tRNAi ternary complex recognition of the initiator codon. <br />  <br />  <br />    Initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells involves the          pressors of a His2 mutant strain, in which the AUG initiation <br /> binding of the initiator methionyl-tRNAi (Met-tRNAi) and                     codon for HIS4 was mutated, were characterized as mutations <br /> mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit, followed by junction of                   in genes whose products affect initiation codon selection.
