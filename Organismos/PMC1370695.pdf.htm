histone deacety- <br /> lases. We present evidence here that this mechanism is conserved in S. cerevisiae, and we identify residues important for the <br /> second step of the reaction, during which the intermediate is resolved into products. We examined 21 Tpt1 protein variants <br /> mutated in conserved residues or blocks of residues and show that one of them, Tpt1 K69A/R71S protein, accumulates large <br /> amounts of intermediate with trinucleotide substrate due to a very slow second step. This intermediate can be trapped on beads <br /> when formed with biotin-NAD. We also show that Tpt1 K69A/R71S protein forms an intermediate with the natural ligated tRNA <br /> substrate and demonstrate that, as expected, this mutation is lethal in yeast. The high degree of conservation of these residues <br /> suggests that the entire Tpt1p family is involved in a similar two-step chemical reaction. <br /> Keywords: yeast; tRNA; splicing; processing; ADP-ribosylation <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                                ecule, a cyclic phosphodiesterase activity that opens the 2&#11032;- <br />                                                                             3&#11032; cyclic phosphate of the 5&#11032;-half-molecule to a 2&#11032;-<span id='am-150' about='obo:NCBITaxon_128483' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_33208 obo:NCBITaxon_33213 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_216303 obo:NCBITaxon_37796 obo:NCBITaxon_1206795 obo:NCBITaxon_69555 obo:NCBITaxon_6447 obo:NCBITaxon_33317 obo:NCBITaxon_6448 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_6479 obo:NCBITaxon_216293 obo:NCBITaxon_6072'><span id='am-151' property="rdfs:label" content="Phos" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-152'  ></span><span id='am-153' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-154' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span>phos</span>- <br /> 2&#11032;-phosphotransferase (Tpt1) is an essential protein that <br />                                                                             phate, and a ligase activity that fuses the two half-molecules <br /> catalyzes the final step of tRNA splicing in the yeast Sac- <br />                                                                             through an adenylylated intermediate to form ligated tRNA <br /> charomyces cerevisiae (Spinelli et al. 1997). tRNA splicing in <br />                                                                             bearing a splice junction 2&#11032;-phosphate (Greer et al. 1983; <br /> S. cerevisiae initiates with excision of the intron by the tRNA <br />                                                                             Phizicky et al. 1986, 1992; Belford et al. 1993; Westaway et <br /> splicing endonuclease, by cleavage of each intron-exon bor- <br />                                                                             al. 1993; Sawaya et al. 2003).

If R71 is critical for <br /> efficient catalysis of the second step, and the residue is so          <br /> highly conserved, it seems highly likely that it is important        <br /> for the second step of a dephosphorylation or similar reac-            <br /> tion in other organisms. Our method of isolating the reac-             <br /> tion intermediate using biotin-NAD and Tpt1 K69A/R71S <br /> protein (Fig. 6) may aid in identification of other substrates         <br /> of the yeast enzyme, such as HAC1 mRNA (Gonzalez et al. <br /> 1999), or of substrates of other Tpt1 family members.                  <br />                                                                     <br /> MATERIALS AND METHODS                                 <br /> Construction and verification of site-directed mutants                 <br /> in TPT1                                                              <br /> Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Kunkel muta-   <br /> genesis procedure (Kunkel et al. 1987), using oligomers with the       <br /> appropriate nucleotide changes and pET 24b containing wild-type <br />                                                                      <br /> TPT1, followed by transformation into E. coli XL1 Blue strains.           <br /> Mutations were confirmed initially by restriction analysis since       <br /> mutagenic oligomers also alter the restriction enzyme pattern, and   <br /> then by DNA sequencing.         <br /> Purification of Tpt1 protein variants        <br /> pET 24b <span id='am-145' about='obo:NCBITaxon_36549' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_28384'><span id='am-146' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-147' property="rdfs:label" content="plasmids" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-148' property="oboInOwl:hasAlternativeId" content="NCBITaxon:2435" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-149' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:11" datatype="xsd:string"></span>plasmids</span> expressing Tpt1p-His6 variants were trans-              <br /> formed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3), followed by growth at 37&#176;C   <br /> and induction of expression at A600 0.4 by addition of 1 mM IPTG         <br /> for 2 h.
