Mob1p is a phosphoprotein in vivo and a substrate for <br />         the Mps1p kinase in vitro. Conditional alleles of MOB1 cause a late nuclear division <br />         arrest at restrictive temperature. MOB1 exhibits genetic interaction with three other yeast <br />         genes required for the completion of mitosis, LTE1, CDC5, and CDC15 (the latter two <br />         encode essential protein kinases). Most haploid mutant mob1 strains also display a <br />         complete increase in ploidy at permissive temperature. The mechanism for the increase <br />         in ploidy may occur through MPS1 function. One mob1 strain, which maintains stable <br />         haploidy at both permissive and restrictive temperature, diploidizes at permissive tem- <br />         perature when combined with the mps1&#8211;1 mutation. Strains containing mob2D also <br />         display a complete increase in ploidy when combined with the mps1-1 mutation. Perhaps <br />         in addition to, or as part of, its essential function in late mitosis, MOB1 is required for a <br />         cell cycle reset function necessary for the initiation of the spindle pole body duplication. <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                      causes an increase in ploidy to yield polyploid cells.

In an attempt to establish <br /> additional genetic interactions shared between MOB1 <br /> and MOB2, we looked for synthetic phenotypes dis- <br /> played by mob1 mob2D double mutants and we found <br /> none. mob1&#8211;77 mob2D and mob1&#8211;95 mob2D double mu- <br /> tants are maintained as stable haploids and grow at <br /> wild-type rates at permissive temperature. They arrest <br /> in late mitosis, as do the mob1 single mutants, at re- <br /> strictive temperature (our unpublished results). Fur- <br /> thermore, high-copy plasmids harboring wild-type <br /> MOB2 are unable to suppress either the increase-in- <br /> ploidy phenotype or the late nuclear division arrest of <br /> mob1 mutants at restrictive temperature (our unpub- <br /> lished results). <br />  <br />  <br /> The Cell Cycle Arrest of mob1 Cells Does Not <br /> Require MPS1 <br /> Although MPS1 has no known function in late mitosis, <br /> it was possible that MOB1 requires MPS1 for its role in <br /> late mitosis. To address this possibility, we tested <br /> whether cells harboring mob1 mutations require MPS1 <br /> to arrest in late nuclear division at restrictive temper- <br /> ature. We first synchronized mob1&#8211;77 mps1&#8211;1 and <br /> mob1&#8211;95 mps1&#8211;1 double mutants in G1 with the mat- <br /> ing pheromone, a factor, and released them into me- <br /> dia containing hydroxyurea.
