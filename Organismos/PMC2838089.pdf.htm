BicD1 is known to interact with the dynein motor complex and the Rab6 GTPase. <br />           The interaction between pp150 and BicD1 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and fluorescence reso- <br />           nance energy transfer. Depletion of BicD1 with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) caused decreased virus yield and <br />           a defect in trafficking of pp150 to the cytoplasmic viral assembly compartment (AC), without altering traf- <br />           ficking to the AC of another essential tegument protein, pp28, or the viral glycoprotein complex gM/gN. The <br />           C terminus of BicD1 has been previously shown to interact with the GTPase Rab6, suggesting a potential role <br />           for Rab6-mediated vesicular trafficking in HCMV assembly. Finally, overexpression of the N terminus of <br />           truncated BicD1 acts in a dominant-negative manner and leads to disruption of the AC and a decrease in the <br />           assembly of infectious virus. <span id='am-55' about='obo:NCBITaxon_169495' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_33340 obo:NCBITaxon_33213 obo:NCBITaxon_169440 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_7147 obo:NCBITaxon_43733 obo:NCBITaxon_33154 obo:NCBITaxon_43738 obo:NCBITaxon_480117 obo:NCBITaxon_33317 obo:NCBITaxon_169449 obo:NCBITaxon_480118 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_6072 obo:NCBITaxon_6960 obo:NCBITaxon_43750 obo:NCBITaxon_33208 obo:NCBITaxon_85512 obo:NCBITaxon_197562 obo:NCBITaxon_197563 obo:NCBITaxon_7203 obo:NCBITaxon_6656 obo:NCBITaxon_7496 obo:NCBITaxon_1206794 obo:NCBITaxon_88770 obo:NCBITaxon_33392 obo:NCBITaxon_169455 obo:NCBITaxon_50557 obo:NCBITaxon_43741'><span id='am-56' property="rdfs:label" content="This" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-57'  ></span><span id='am-58' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-59' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span>This</span> phenotype was similar to that observed following overexpression of dyna- <br />           mitin (p50) and provided additional evidence that morphogenesis of the AC and virus assembly were dynein <br />           dependent. <br />  <br />  <br />    Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (<span id='am-25' about='obo:NCBITaxon_10359' typeof='owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_10358 obo:NCBITaxon_10357 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_548681 obo:NCBITaxon_35237 obo:NCBITaxon_10239 obo:NCBITaxon_10292'><span id='am-26' property="oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym" content="Human cytomegalovirus" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-27' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-28' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="human herpesvirus type 5" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-29' property="rdfs:label" content="Human herpesvirus 5" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-30' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="Human cytomegalovirus HCMV" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-31' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-32'  ></span><span id='am-33' property="oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym" content="human cytomegalovirus CMV" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-34' property="oboInOwl:hasBroadSynonym" content="HHV-5" datatype="xsd:string"></span>human herpesvirus 5</span>                         way and protein interactions required for formation of the <br /> [HHV-5]), the prototypical betaherpesvirus, is ubiquitous in                 tegument layer and the role of individual tegument proteins in <br /> humans and establishes a persistent infection in the host (19).              the replication and assembly of infectious HCMV remain <br /> HCMV also reinfects healthy seropositive individuals, suggest-               poorly understood.

As noted above, Rab6 has been <br /> still unknown, and the Chlamydia proteins that interact with           proposed to have a role in the formation of the Chlamydia <br /> BicD1 have not been identified (57). It is of considerable             inclusion body, although the precise function has not been <br /> interest that during its intracellular replication Chlamydia           described (57). Similarly, its potential role in the assembly of <br /> forms an inclusion body in immediate proximity to the MTOC             HCMV is not understood. Currently our laboratory has studies <br /> in HeLa cells and that its localization to this site is dynein         under way to dissect the potential role of this small GTPase in <br /> dependent although not inhibited by overexpression of dyna-            the formation of the AC and in the assembly of the infectious <br /> mitin, an observation suggesting a dynein-dependent but dyn-           HCMV virion. <br /> actin-independent mechanism of microtubule transport (30). <br /> Recently, it has been shown that BicD1 localized to the Chla-                               <br /> mydia inclusion in the absence of Rab6 activity, suggesting that        <br /> BicD1 dynein binding activity and interactions with as-yet-            <br /> undefined Chlamydia proteins were the only requirements for            <br />  <br /> of the UAB High Resolution Imaging Facility for help with the FRET                   <br /> experiments, and UAB neuroscience core C.                                       <br />   UAB neuroscience core C is supported by grant P30-NS47466.
