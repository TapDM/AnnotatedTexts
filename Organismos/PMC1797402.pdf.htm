Strikingly, despite the fact that GFP- <br /> FtsN complemented a strain in which FtsN was depleted and <br /> localized normally at 42&#176;C, overexpression of GFP-FtsN was <br /> unable to restore viability to a strain in which FtsK was de- <br /> pleted at the same temperature (Table 1). Consistent with a <br /> loss of divisome stability, both FtsL and FtsQ did not localize <br /> under these conditions, and cells were unable to divide (Fig. <br /> 1E and F). <br />    Previous studies have reported rescue of cells lacking FtsK <br /> by FtsN overexpression. However, the resulting cells grow <br /> poorly, form filaments, and show a loss of viability (6, 7). We <br /> considered the possibility that the growth defects seen in these <br /> studies compared to the relatively efficient suppression in our <br /> analysis might have been due to residual FtsK expression from <br /> the repressed pBAD42 (Spcr) plasmid pJC85. We examined <br /> whether an FtsK depletion strain expressing GFP-FtsN <br /> (JOE702) could lose the FtsK complementing plasmid when it <br /> was transformed with incompatible empty plasmid pBAD42 <br /> (Kanr) and plated under GFP-FtsN overexpression conditions <br /> (with IPTG).

(B) PCR analysis of wrinkled (Spcs) colonies, which lost the pBAD42-ftsK(Spcr) complementing <br /> plasmid, failed to show products with primer pairs specific for ftsK (products 1, 2, and 3), consistent with plasmid loss, while yielding the expected <br /> &#11011;1.6-kb fragment for the ftsK::cat-&#9004;5 allele (product 4). Smooth (Spcr) colonies which maintained the complementing plasmid contained both the <br /> ftsK::cat-&#9004;5 allele and the plasmid-encoded ftsK gene. PCR analysis of wild-type cells yielded products consistent with the presence of ftsK but not <br /> with the presence of the ftsK::cat-&#9004;5 allele.

Thus, we concluded that NcytoTM, which does          <br /> not show obvious conservation, is essential for suppression of     <br /> an FtsK depletion strain, while the relatively conserved C- <br /> terminal murein-binding domain (NMB) is dispensable.                                                 <br />    We also asked whether NcytoTM is required for FtsN over- <br />                                                                       <br /> expression rescue of other division defects as well. In fact, we     <br /> found that NcytoTM is also necessary to suppress the ftsQ1(Ts)          <br /> allele as FFN failed to rescue at all levels of induction. Similar       <br /> to the case with the FtsK depletion strain and in contrast to          <br /> FFN, FtsN241 was also able to suppress ftsQ1(Ts). However, in        <br /> this case, the suppression was somewhat less than that seen               <br /> with full-length FtsN (Table 2). Thus, NcytoTM, previously pos-        <br /> tulated to be important only for promoting translocation and         <br /> anchoring of the periplasmic domain in the appropriate cellu-         <br /> lar compartment, turns out to play a general role in facilitating    <br /> divisome assembly. In contrast, although we obtained some             <br /> evidence that NMB allows FtsN to suppress ftsQ1(Ts) more    <br /> efficiently, if NMB does in fact play a role in cell division, its       <br /> contribution is likely to be minor or redundant. <br />                                                                     <br />    Previous work on mutant cell division proteins has focused           <br /> primarily on testing for the abilities of these proteins to com-    <br /> plement null alleles. Such an approach has yielded significant        <br /> insights into the essential domains of the division proteins,          <br /> providing a framework for understanding protein function.             <br /> This work, however, highlights the limitations of relying on           <br /> complementation for growth and division as the only measure       <br /> of fts protein function, particularly because our understanding          <br /> of the ultimate functions of many of the division proteins is          <br /> incomplete. Here, by assaying the role of FtsN with a non-           <br /> standard assay (suppression of the &#9004;ftsK::cat-&#9004;5 allele) we             <br /> were able to discover a novel role for a nonessential domain     <br /> of FtsN.                                                            <br />    This finding adds to the increasing number of observations        <br /> of a specific role for the cytoplasmic and/or transmembrane              <br /> segments of cell division proteins in divisome assembly. This          <br /> role appears to be established even though, at least in the case    <br /> of the bitopic membrane proteins (FtsQ, FtsL, FtsB, FtsI, and      <br /> FtsN), there is no obvious conservation in these regions and in         <br /> several cases (FtsQ and FtsN) these N-terminal regions have        <br /> been shown to be &#8220;nonessential&#8221; for function in standard               <br /> complementation assays (7, 10, 11, 13, 16). Together, these          <br /> observations point to a model in which the N-terminal cyto-         <br /> plasmic and/or transmembrane domains of (most likely all)             <br /> </body></html>
