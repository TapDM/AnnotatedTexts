Biochemical evidence for an interaction was provided by the copurification on immunoglobulin <br />           G-Sepharose of Nip7p with protein A-tagged Rrp43p and Nop8p. Cells depleted of Nop8p contained reduced <br />           levels of free 60S ribosomes and polysomes and accumulated half-mer polysomes. Nop8p-depleted cells also <br />           accumulated 35S pre-rRNA and an aberrant 23S pre-rRNA. Nop8p-depleted cells failed to accumulate either <br />           25S or 27S rRNA, although they did synthesize significant levels of 18S rRNA. These results indicate that 27S <br />           or 25S rRNA is degraded in Nop8p-depleted cells after the section containing 18S rRNA is removed. Nip7p- <br />           depleted cells exhibited the same defects as Nop8p-depleted cells, except that they accumulated 27S precursors. <br />           Rrp43p is a component of the exosome, a complex of 3*-to-5* exonucleases whose subunits have been implicated <br />           in 5.8S rRNA processing and mRNA turnover. Whereas both green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Nop8p and GFP- <br />           Nip7p localized to nucleoli, GFP-Rrp43p localized throughout the nucleus and to a lesser extent in the cyto- <br />           plasm. Distinct pools of Rrp43p may interact both with the exosome and with Nip7p, possibly both in the nu- <br />           cleus and in the cytoplasm, to catalyze analogous reactions in the multistep process of 60S ribosome biogenesis <br />           and mRNA turnover. <br />  <br />  <br />    Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes occurs mostly in the nu-                 is responsible for endonucleolytic processing at A3 in ITS1 (31). <br /> cleolus, where rRNA is transcribed, processed, and covalently                 Two 59-to-39 exonucleases, Rat1p and Xrn1p, are required for <br /> modified, newly synthesized ribosomal proteins (rproteins) are                maturation of the 5.8SS rRNA 59 end (17) and for the degra- <br /> delivered, and 40S and 60S subunits are assembled. While the                  dation of several excised spacer sequences, including frag- <br /> mechanism of ribosome synthesis is complex and poorly un-                     ments A0 to A1, A2 to A3, and D to A2 (27, 49). The five sub- <br /> derstood, significant progress has been made toward identify-                 units of the exosome complex (35) and Rrp6p (5) are required <br /> ing and characterizing rproteins, and the many nonribosomal                   for maturation of 5.8S rRNA. The putative RNA helicases <br /> factors that are required for ribosome biogenesis, in Saccha-                 Fal1p, Dbp4p, Rok1p, and Rrp3p (25, 30, 39, 56) are required <br /> romyces cerevisiae. The completion of the yeast genome project                for 40S subunit synthesis, and the putative helicases Dbp3p, <br /> secured the identification of 137 genes (59 of which were du-                 Dbp6p, Dbp7p, Dob1p, Drs1p, and Sbp4p are required for 60S <br /> plicated) that encode 32 40S and 46 60S rproteins (32). The                   synthesis (7, 8, 26, 41, 43, 60). <br /> 18S rRNA of 40S subunits and the 5.8S and 25S rRNAs of 60S                       In addition to the snoRNAs, nucleases, and RNA helicases, <br /> subunits are transcribed as a single 35S pre-rRNA. The orga-                  a number of other nucleolar proteins are required for ribo- <br /> nization of 35S pre-rRNA, including the locations of the ma-                  some biogenesis. The best characterized of these proteins is <br /> ture rRNAs; two internal transcribed spacers, ITS1 and ITS2;                  Nop1p, an abundant protein that is required for many steps of <br /> and two external transcribed spacers, 59 ETS and 39 ETS, is                   both 40S and 60S synthesis, including rRNA methylation and <br /> shown in Fig. 1. rRNAs are formed by ordered endo- and exo-                   processing and subunit assembly (52, 53). Nop1p is common to <br /> nucleolytic digestion of the spacer sequences and by covalent                 a large number of snoRNAs (45) and associates with four <br /> modifications that include ribose and base methylation and                    nucleolar proteins, Nop56p, Nop58p, Nop77p/Nop4p, and <br /> conversion of uridine residues to pseudouridine (27, 40, 61).                 Sof1p (4, 13, 21, 50). Several other proteins, including Gar1p, <br />    Many, but certainly not all, trans-acting factors that function            Mpp10p, Sof1p, and Ssb1p, were shown to interact with one or <br /> in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly have been                        more snoRNAs (6, 11, 15, 21). Genetic depletion of Gar1p, <br /> identified. Four small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), U3, U14,                     Mpp10p, and Sof1p impairs 18S synthesis and 40S subunit <br /> snR10, and snR30 (20, 28, 36, 51), have been implicated in                    formation (11, 15, 21). On the other hand, Nip7p, Nop2p, <br /> pre-rRNA cleavages leading to the synthesis of 18S rRNA, but                  Nop56p, Nop58p, and Nop77p/Nop4p are involved in 60S sub- <br /> most snoRNAs function as guides for enzymes that catalyze                     unit synthesis (4, 13, 19, 50, 62). Rrp5p has been implicated in <br /> either rRNA methylation or pseudouridinylation (48, 54). Sev-                 18S and 5.8S rRNA synthesis, since its deficiency blocks cleav- <br /> eral nucleases are responsible for endo- and exonucleolytic                   ages in the 59 ETS and ITS1, leading to accumulation of an <br /> processing and for degradation of the spacer sequences.

The <br /> function of certain exosomal subunits is not restricted to 5.8S <br /> rRNA processing. Benard et al. (3) have reported that the <br /> ski6-2 allele of Rrp41p/Ski6p accumulated a 38S particle de- <br /> rived from the 60S subunit containing a truncated part of the <br /> 25S rRNA and lacking the 5.8S rRNA. In addition, Anderson <br /> and Parker (1) have shown that Rrp4p and Rrp41p/Ski6p also <br /> participate in mRNA degradation, and there is evidence that a <br /> fraction of Rrp4p is present in the cytoplasm (34). Our results <br /> with GFP-Rrp43p suggest that it too may be partially localized <br /> in the cytoplasm. <br />    In addition to Nip7p, other polypeptides associate with exo- <br /> some subunits.

With Nip7p and Rrp43p, <br /> however, in vivo depletion resulted in the accumulation of <br /> distinct precursors along the pathway leading to the synthesis <br /> of the 60S subunit rRNAs (34, 62).

A deficiency of Nip7p, however, causes the                            <br /> accumulation of aberrant precursors containing 5.8S sequence                          <br /> (62). In Nop8p-depleted cells, no accumulation of the 27S                          <br /> precursor was observed and the defect in 60S subunit <span id='am-116' about='obo:NCBITaxon_forma' typeof='owl:Thing NCBITaxon:_taxonomic_rank'><span id='am-117' property="rdfs:label" content="forma" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-118' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span>forma</span>-                          <br /> tion in these cells may be due to 27S pre-rRNA or 25S rRNA                           <br />                                                                                       <br /> degradation.                                                                     <br />    Non-rprotein mutants with deficiencies in 60S subunit syn-                       <br /> thesis fall into two main groups. Deficiencies in Nip7p, Dob1p,                      <br /> Dbp3p, Drs1p, Nop2p, and Nop56p (8, 13, 19, 41, 60, 62) arrest              <br />                                                                                    <br /> 25S and 5.8S rRNA synthesis at the level of 27S pre-rRNA and                         <br /> accumulate 27S precursors. Deficiencies in Nop8p, Dbp6p,                      <br /> Dbp7p, and Nop77p/Nop4p (4, 7, 26, 50) also arrest 25S and                        <br /> 5.8S synthesis but do not accumulate 27S pre-rRNA, which                            <br />                                                                                  <br /> presumably is targeted for degradation. In both cases, the final                   <br /> result is a deficit of 60S subunits. Many of these nucleolar                  <br /> proteins, including Nip7p and Nop8p, lack known enzymatic                           <br /> </body></html>
