In conclusion, we identified the molecular nature of a <br />      cryptic genetic variation and characterized its evolutionary history. These results show that cryptic genetic variation does <br />      not necessarily accumulate neutrally at the whole-organism level, but may evolve through selection for pleiotropic effects <br />      that alter fitness. In addition, cultivation in the laboratory has led to adaptive evolution of the reference strain N2 to the <br />      laboratory environment, which may modify other phenotypes of interest. <br />  <br /> Introduction                                                                            cryptic variation in response to the marked change of lifestyle that <br />                                                                                         occurred in the last generations [6]. <br />    Many developmental systems produce outputs that are insensitive                         Two different hypotheses could explain the evolutionary origin <br /> to a wide range of environmental or genetic perturbations.
