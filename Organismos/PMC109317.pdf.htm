This was the first evi-    <br /> dence that a nonimmunophilin TPR-containing protein can   <br /> associate with Hsp90 in mature receptor complexes. Our dis-   <br /> covery (and that described in reference 14) that Cns1 is an     <br /> essential nonimmunophilin TPR-containing component of the   <br /> Hsp90 machinery suggests that these complexes are even more    <br /> heterogeneous than previously thought. Whether Cns1 occu-     <br /> pies specific niches among different types of heterocomplexes         <br /> or even defines such complexes remains to be determined. The   <br /> mammalian Hsp90-associated immunophilins do not precipi-         <br /> tate with other Hsp90-associated immunophilins, indicating           <br /> that TPR-containing immunophilins are not present in the                <br /> same complex (see references 37 and 47 for reviews). Based on      <br /> these and other studies, the stoichiometry of Hsp90-receptor                <br /> complexes has been postulated to include one TPR-containing                <br /> immunophilin per Hsp90 dimer (12, 39, 47). However, we                    <br /> found Cns1 among the proteins that could be removed from           <br /> solution by GST-Cpr7. Thus, if Cns1 interacts directly with             <br /> Hsp90 via its TPR domains, the one-TPR-accepting-pocket&#8211;                <br /> one-TPR-partner hypothesis may be insufficient to explain the              <br /> precipitation of Cns1 by Cpr7.                                         <br />                                                                        <br />    Although Hsp90-associated proteins are highly conserved     <br /> among eukaryotes, in S. cerevisiae many, including Sti1 (p60),            <br /> Cpr6 and Cpr7 (Cyp40), Ydj1 (DnaJ), Sba1 (p23), and Ppt1                <br /> (PP5), are not essential (16, 20, 28, 34, 46). In contrast, Cns1       <br /> is essential at all temperatures (2). Moreover, the lethality                <br /> caused by the cns1D mutation cannot be suppressed by over-              <br /> expression of other TPR-containing proteins, including Cpr6,              <br /> Cpr7, or Sti1.
