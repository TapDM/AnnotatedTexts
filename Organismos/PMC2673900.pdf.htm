It is interesting to note <br /> We describe the previously unreported ability of NUD-1 to        that while our assays indicate that NUD-1 shares many <br /> function as a molecular chaperone, with multiple substrates      characteristics with proteins in the sHsp family, there are <br /> and across a variety of established assays.

These proteins predominantly consist of the <br /> chaperones in the sHsp family. One of the features of some       p23/Hsp20 domain with no other known functional <br /> sHsps is that their oligomeric state can be altered by           domains present (Weikl et al. 1999; Stromer et al. 2003). <br /> phosphorylation, sometimes changing chaperone activity           However, within NUD-1, the p23/HSP20 domain is fused <br /> levels (Sun and MacRae 2005).

Therefore, it might not be surprising <br /> prevented more than 90% of the aggregation of CS and             that NUD-1 appears to have characteristics of multiple <br /> luciferase at equimolar concentrations.
