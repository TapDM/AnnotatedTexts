The membrane-bound portion of <br /> the pool of this GTP-binding protein has a PI anchor cova-            <br /> lently attached to an internal amino acid (31). Another              <br />                                                                           <br /> function of this protein is the binding and bundling ofF-actin.      <br /> The recent finding that an EF-la plant homolog is also a                   <br /> membrane-bound activator of PI 4-kinase (32), together with           <br /> reports of PI 4-kinases found on the surface of vesicles (14)             <br /> and isolated together with F-actin (33), may indicate that both        <br /> kinase activities are crucial in vesicle budding processes, as             <br /> shown for the internalization of tyrosine receptor kinases by        <br /> endocytotic events in mammalian cells (2).                                 <br />    PI 3-Klnase Actvity In Prnts. PI 3-kinase activity has so far           <br /> not been found in plant protein extracts (13), and we also                 <br /> failed to detect this activity in control plant extracts (Fig. 4B,    <br /> lane 2). The existence of PI 3-kinase could be inferred from              <br /> labeling patterns of lipids extracted from duckweed (5) or            <br /> guard cells of <span id='am-49' about='obo:NCBITaxon_4743' typeof='obo:NCBITaxon_4739 owl:Thing obo:NCBITaxon_78536 obo:NCBITaxon_1 obo:NCBITaxon_4740 obo:NCBITaxon_131567 obo:NCBITaxon_4447 obo:NCBITaxon_4734 obo:NCBITaxon_3398 obo:NCBITaxon_1437183 obo:NCBITaxon_33090 obo:NCBITaxon_131221 obo:NCBITaxon_58024 obo:NCBITaxon_58023 obo:NCBITaxon_2759 obo:NCBITaxon_35493 obo:NCBITaxon_1437197 obo:NCBITaxon_3193'><span id='am-50' property="rdfs:label" content="Commelina" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-51' property="oboInOwl:hasDbXref" content="GC_ID:1" datatype="xsd:string"></span><span id='am-52'  ></span><span id='am-53' property="oboInOwl:hasOBONamespace" content="ncbi_taxonomy" datatype="xsd:string"></span>Commelina</span> communes (34) labeled with appro-           <br /> priate radioactive precursors. We detected very low levels of        <br /> PI 3-kinase activity (compared with PI 4-kinase activity) in         <br /> transgenic callus cells overexpressing AtVPS34 (Fig. 4B). PI                <br /> 3-phosphate and PI 4-phosphate were not completely sepa-             <br /> rated as unique spots in this chromatographic system. Nev-                 <br /> ertheless, we believe that the spot identified as PI 3 is not       <br /> caused by &quot;fronting&quot; from the PI 4 spot because increased                   <br /> loading (5-fold) did not produce such a spot when extract                  <br /> from an untransformed plant was used. Headgroup analysis,            <br /> as done for yeast (3), will be necessary to confirm unequiv-               <br /> ocally that this spot represents PI 3-kinase activity. mRNA                <br /> for the enzyme was more readily detected than enzyme                        <br /> activity (Fig. 4A). The low level of active enzyme may be                  <br /> caused by rapid inactivation in cell extracts or the absence of     <br /> a required activation step, leaving most of the enzyme                     <br /> inactive, as occurs in ScVPS34-overexpressing yeast cells <br /> </body></html>
