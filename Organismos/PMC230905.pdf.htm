Like Met30p, Hir1p and Tup1p do not appear to be         transcriptional factors that belong to the WD40 protein family, <br /> DNA-binding proteins. To explain how such molecules could          Hir1p, Met30p, and Tup1p, are all negative regulators without <br /> repress transcription, it has been proposed that they are re-      a DNA-binding domain and that mutations in them were all <br /> cruited to the target promoters by interacting with specific       found to produce pleiotropic effects on transcription (34, 36, <br /> DNA-bound factors. Such a model was later confirmed by             43; this study). This suggests that the ability to bind multiple <br /> several studies on the function of Tup1p (23, 25, 44).

In contrast to Tup1p, we show here that                                  <br /> Met30p did not repress transcription when it was tethered to a <br /> promoter through a fusion with the DNA-binding domain of             <br /> LexA.                                                               <br />    During this work, we have identified one target of Met30p as     <br /> Met4p, a transcriptional activator regulating the sulfate assim-    <br /> ilation pathway. Met4p was shown to respond to the level of        <br /> intracellular AdoMet: an increase in the intracellular AdoMet <br /> level inhibits the transcription activation function of Met4p                                        <br /> (27). A functional analysis of Met4p has demonstrated that this      <br /> activator contains, in addition to its bZIP, three domains: one         <br /> activation domain, located in the NH2-terminal part of the          <br /> protein; an inhibitory region, which mediates the AdoMet in-         <br /> hibition of the activation domain; and an auxiliary domain,             <br /> which counteracts the function of the inhibitory region when         <br /> the intracellular AdoMet level is low (27). Using LexA-Met4            <br /> fusion proteins, we show here that MET30 mutations prevent             <br /> the AdoMet-mediated inhibition of the Met4p activation func-         <br /> tion. Since a model explaining the intramolecular regulation of         <br />                                                                        <br /> Met4p predicted the interaction of the Met4p inhibitory region      <br /> with a regulatory protein (27), these results led us to look for       <br /> physical interactions between Met4p and Met30p. Using vari-          <br /> ous Gal4-Met4 derivatives, we demonstrate here by the two-             <br />                                                                         <br /> hybrid method that Met4p and Met30p interact in vivo. More-         <br /> over, we show that the inhibitory region of Met4p is involved         <br /> in this interaction. As the two-hybrid experiments were per-           <br /> formed in nonrepressive growth conditions, the results suggest      <br />                                                                        <br /> that Met4p and Met30p may form a complex even when the                 <br /> intracellular AdoMet level is low.                                     <br />    From these results, we propose that Met30p functions as a        <br /> transcriptional inhibitor which interacts with the Met4p inhib-        <br />                                                                         <br /> itory region to repress the activation domain when the intra-      <br /> cellular AdoMet level is high. Further studies are required to          <br /> define more accurately how Met30p functions and to under-              <br /> stand how the AdoMet signal is transduced to the Met4-Met30         <br /> couple. It would be also of importance to determine why, in            <br /> contrast to the met30 null mutation, the isolated alleles of       <br /> MET30 are dominant for the regulatory effect. In contrast to          <br /> that of Met4p, the function of Met30p is not restricted to the         <br /> sulfate assimilation pathway but also concerns the methyl cycle        <br /> and the AdoMet-mediated regulation of MET19, which en-             <br /> codes the first enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (data           <br /> not shown). This implies that Met30p has the ability to interact    <br /> with transcriptional factors other than Met4p. Such multiple            <br /> interactions would be possible because of the presence of               <br /> WD40 repeats within Met30p. Indeed, each WD40 repeat is            <br /> theoretically capable of interacting with at least one other            <br /> protein, as demonstrated by the recent study of the interactions   <br /> between Tup1p and homeodomain protein a2 (25). The lethal-             <br /> ity associated with MET30 gene disruption is consistent with      <br /> the involvement of Met30p in the regulation of numerous sets           <br /> of genes. Perhaps this lethality originates from the central       <br /> metabolic position filled by AdoMet, which is second only to            <br /> ATP in the number of reactions in which it participates (8).
