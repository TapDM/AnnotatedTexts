It was found that all <br />            three mutants are completely defective in inducing growth in soft agar but possess a range of activities in assays <br />            of focus formation on cell monolayers. Furthermore, when assays of middle T antigen-associated kinase <br />            activities were performed in vitro, a correlation between the level of associated phosphatidylinositol kinase <br />            activity and the ability of mutant middle T antigens to induce focus formation was observed. However, the <br />            association of this activity with middle T antigen does not appear to be sufficient to bring about full <br />            transformation, since the middle T antigen derived from d11015 is completely defective for soft-agar growth but <br />            is associated with a level of phosphatidylinositol kinase activity which is comparable to that of the wild type. <br />            Therefore, some other unidentified middle T antigen function may also be required for full transformation. <br />  <br />  <br />   The middle T antigen (MTAg) of polyomavirus has             an          can   phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI) in vitro, a prop- <br /> acute transforming activity which has been well studied in                erty shared with other oncogene products (23, 28, 45, 52). <br /> recent years.
