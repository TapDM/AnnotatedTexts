Both changes germline morphology reversible: Upon re-feeding, the <br />      shrunken germlines regenerated, multiple oocytes formed concurrently. The capacity germline regeneration upon <br />      re-feeding limited small subset animals normally survive starvation: When bagging prevented <br />      ectopically par-2 RNAi, virtually germlines regenerated. In addition, germline shrinkage strongly correlated with <br />      oogenesis, suggesting starvation, germline shrinkage provide material oocyte production.

By day 4 starvation, majority tracked embryos <br /> had hatched died: At 61.4% (n = 402) these <br /> embryos hatched, 31.3% died; remained early <br /> embryogenesis (Figure 2A, Figure S2A).
