The HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) gene, which is encoded by the minus strand of the <br />   viral genome, is expressed as an antisense transcript in all ATL cases. By using yeast two-hybrid screening, we <br />   identified activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) as an HBZ-interacting protein. ATF3 has been reported <span id='am-3' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> be <br />   expressed in ATL cells, but its biological significance is not known. <br />   Results: Immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that ATF3 interacts with HBZ. Expression of ATF3 was upregulated <br />   in ATL cell lines and fresh ATL cases. Reporter assay revealed that ATF3 could interfere with the HTLV-1 Tax&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s <br />   transactivation of the 5&#226;&#8364;&#8482; proviral long terminal repeat (LTR), doing so by affecting the ATF/CRE site, as well as HBZ. <br />   Suppressing ATF3 expression inhibited proliferation and strongly reduced the viability of ATL cells. As mechanisms <br />   of growth-promoting activity of ATF3, comparative expression profiling of ATF3 knockdown cells identified <br />   candidate genes that are critical for the cell cycle and cell death, including cell division cycle 2 (CDC2) and cyclin <br />   E2. ATF3 also enhanced p53 transcriptional activity, but this activity was suppressed by HBZ. <br />   Conclusions: Thus, ATF3 expression has positive and negative effects on the proliferation and <span
