Introduction <br />                                                  Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a modified tetrapyrrole that belongs to <br /> Correspondence e-mail: keith@ysbl.york.ac.uk     the same family of metallo-prosthetic groups as haem, chlorophyll, <br />                                                  sirohaem and coenzyme F430 (Warren &amp; Scott, 1990). Modified <br />                                                  tetrapyrroles are synthesized via a branched biosynthetic pathway, <br /> Received 23 January 2005                         with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) the first common intermediate and <br /> Accepted 3 March 2005                            uroporphyrinogen III the first branch-point step in the pathway.

For cobalamin <br />                                                  biosynthesis, two distinct yet similar routes exist, known as the <br />                                                  oxygen-dependent (aerobic) and oxygen-independent (anaerobic) <br />                                                  pathways (Roessner et al., 2001; Warren et al., 2002). The aerobic <br />                                                  pathway is found in bacteria such as Psuedomonas denitrificans and <br />                                                  P. aeruginosa, whereas the more common anaerobic route is found in <br />                                                  the archaea and eubacteria such as Salmonella enterica and Bacillus <br />                                                  megaterium. The enzymes of the aerobic pathway are given the prefix <br />                                                  Cob, whereas those of the anaerobic pathway are termed Cbi. <br />                                                     Although the anaerobic pathway to cobalamin has yet to be <br />                                                  completely elucidated, all the intermediates in the aerobic pathway <br />                                                  have now been elucidated and the enzyme activities determined. <br />                                                  However, even in the aerobic pathway there are some proteins that <br />                                                  are known to be required for cobalamin biosynthesis yet for which no <br />                                                  function has been assigned. One of these proteins is CobE, a <br />                                                  comparatively small protein with a molecular weight of about 15 kDa. <br />                                                  An orthologue of this protein, CbiG, is also found in the anaerobic <br />                                                  pathway. CobE displays about 25% identity with the C-terminal <br />                                                  region of CbiG, a 350-amino-acid protein for which no function has <br />                                                  yet been ascribed. Genetic studies have shown that deletion of either <br />                                                  CbiG or CobE from their respective pathways leads to a drastic <br />                                                  reduction in cobalamin biosynthesis (less than 1% of the levels found <br />                                                  in control strains). <br />                                                     As part of a coordinated effort to establish the function of CobE, <br />                                                  we have sought to determine the structure of this protein by X-ray <br />                                                  crystallography. In this paper, we report the crystallization and initial <br />                                                  characterization of CobE. <br />  <br />  <br />                                                  2.
