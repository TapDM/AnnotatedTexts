The A lysis-lysogeny decision and o.32 stability are con-             <br /> trolled by the HflB-governed protease. HflB is an inner membrane             <br /> protein (9) governing AcII proteolysis (11, 12). It has similarities with        <br /> proteases and has putative ATPase activity (8). Inactivation of HflB        <br /> stabilizes c32, whereas overproduction decreases its half-life. The hflB         <br /> gene is positively regulated by o32, providing feedback control of o32           <br /> stability. The AcIII protein stabilizes AcII and o(32 by inhibiting the     <br /> Hf lB-governed protease.                                                        <br />                                                                            <br /> suggest that the regulation of the heat shock response by HflB                   <br /> is highly conserved among bacteria; an equivalent to Cr32 may               <br /> exist in some Gram-positive species.                                             <br />                                                                             <br />    The AcIII protein, responsible for two apparently unrelated                  <br /> phenotypes-increase in A lysogenization frequency and in-                    <br /> duction of the heat shock response-seems to be an inhibitor                 <br /> of the HflB-governed protease.
