Fcp1 induces loss of heparin binding by Pol II in a <br /> Mg2&#226;&#171;&#185;-dependent manner. (A) Heparin-binding behavior of S. <br /> cerevisiae 12-subunit (wtPol II) in the absence and presence of S. <br /> cerevisiae Fcp1 (scFcp1). Consistent amounts of the polymerase <br /> were loaded onto heparin Sepharose columns with or without <br /> the Fcp1, indicated respectively on the top. Consistent volumes <br /> of the flow-through (F.T.) and high-salt elution (Elut) were col- <br /> lected. Contents of the two fractions were analyzed by SDS&#229;&#8230;&#190; <br /> PAGE with polypeptides (marked to the right) revealed by Coo- <br /> massie staining. (B) (Upper) Heparin-binding behaviors of S. <br /> cerevisiae 12-subunit and 10-subunit (&#226;&#338;&#172;4&#229;&#8230;&#190;7) Pol II were charac- <br /> terized by measuring their amounts that flowed through the <br /> microcolumns as functions of the presence of S. pombe Fcp1 <br /> (spFcp1) and BSA. The experiments were performed in the pres- <br /> ence of Mg2&#226;&#171;&#185; (5&#226;&#8364;&#8220;10 mM). (Lower) Proteins bound to the column <br /> after washing were eluted with high salt. The SDS gels were all <br /> stained with Coomassie blue and quantified. Relative molar <br /> amounts of the loading materials were indicated on the top. <br /> Protein bands are identified on the right. Presence of a polymer- <br /> ase in a fraction is revealed by its two largest subunits (Rpb1 and <br /> Rpb2). Note the contaminating bands from the BSA sample do <br /> not match with the positions of Rpb1 and Rpb2, although they <br /> are of high molecular mass. (C) Loss of heparin binding by Pol IIB <br /> in the presence of S. Pombe Fcp1 measured with the same assay. <br /> &#226;&#8364;&#732;&#226;&#8364;&#732;Rpb1b&#226;&#8364;&#8482;&#226;&#8364;&#8482; corresponds to the largest, CTD-less subunit of S. cer- <br /> evisiae Pol II. WT Pol II (wtPol II) was loaded as a marker in lane <br /> 5. (D) Quantification (in ratios) of the gels in B and C. The amount <br /> of the polymerase relative to the control (lane 1 of B) in the <br /> flow-through was a function of the Fcp1&#229;&#8230;&#190;polymerase molar <br /> ratio. For four independent experiments, intensities of Rpb1 <br /> bands in lanes 5&#226;&#8364;&#8220; 8 of B were normalized relative to that of WT <br /> Pol II alone in lane 1, which was low but not zero. The control for &#226;&#338;&#172;4&#229;&#8230;&#190;7 alone was not included in the assay but was assumed to be identical to the WT Pol II control. <br /> Quantification of Rpb1b in the flow-through of C was done in the same manner, except that it was based on a single experiment. Labels on the top of the bars indicate <br /> the corresponding gel lanes in B or C. (E) The effect of Mg2&#226;&#171;&#185; ion on heparin binding by Pol II. The assay was run with an Fcp1&#229;&#8230;&#190;Pol molar ratio of 1.0. In the absence of <br /> MgCl2, the relative amount of Pol II that flowed through the heparin column dramatically reduced as judged by Coomassie staining (compare lanes 1 and 2). <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> were not substrates for human Fcp1 function (27, 34, 39). Second,                     1D), contradicting the previous conclusion that yeast Fcp1 was <br /> Fcp1 seemed specific for their cognate Pol II (26). Third, the Rpb4                   nonfunctional on mammalian polymerase (26). An important dif- <br /> subunit of Pol II was directly involved in the assembly of Pol II&#226;&#8364;&#8220;Fcp1                ference between our experiments and the previous ones is our use <br /> complex in S. pombe (47). Fourth, the CTD-less Pol IIB was able                       of Pol IIO and GST&#226;&#8364;&#8220;CTDo that have been repurified away from <br /> to inhibit human Fcp1 activity, presumably by competing with the                      ATP and the kinase used to phosphorylate the CTD. We believe it <br /> Pol IIO substrate for Fcp1 binding (27).                                              is critical to the CTD phosphatase assay that no CTD&#226;&#8364;&#8220;kinase <br />    Contrary to the docking-site model, we present biochemical                         reaction be allowed to occur. In fact, the main discrepancy between <br /> evidence here that Fcp1 from either budding or fission yeast                          our results and those from which the docking site was proposed <br /> exhibits phosphatase activity toward CTD in the absence of any                        apparently lies in the difference between the assay protocols. For <br /> non-CTD part of the Pol II structure. The kinetic data show nearly                    instance, in one previous report, no further purification was per- <br /> equal efficiency of Fcp1 toward the CTD on Pol II and the CTD                         formed after the in vitro phosphorylation of CTD peptide (27), <br /> fused to GST (Fig. 1 A&#226;&#8364;&#8220;C). We observed no species specificity of                      conceivably permitting rephosphorylation of the CTD during the <br /> Fcp1 from both of the yeast sources toward mammalian Pol II (Fig.                     subsequent dephosphorylation assay.

Whereas Scp <br />                                                                                       was found active against GST&#226;&#8364;&#8220;CTDo, Fcp1 was claimed not to be <br />                                                                                       functional on the same substrate.

We think it does not, because the <br /> from three possible mechanisms: (i) an occlusion caused by direct                                   entire globular structure of Pol II (excluding the CTD) proved <br /> Fcp1 binding in the DNA&#229;&#8230;&#190;RNA site; (ii) a blockage of the cleft by                                   nonessential for the phosphatase function (see the discussion <br /> Fcp1 binding at its opening; and (iii) a closure of the cleft by the                                above). Rather, we speculate that Fcp1 interaction with the non- <br /> clamp domain (55&#226;&#8364;&#8220;57). The first mechanism might be discounted by                                    CTD site may play phosphatase-independent roles, such as stimu- <br /> the considerations that (i) the DNA&#229;&#8230;&#190;RNA site is &#226;&#172;&#8225;75 &#195;&#8230; deep but                                      lating elongation (39&#226;&#8364;&#8220;41) by stabilizing the DNA&#229;&#8230;&#190;RNA hybrid in <br /> only 25 &#195;&#8230; wide, a potential topological problem for a protein as                                    the cleft. <br /> large as pombe Fcp1 (82 kDa) and that (ii) the nucleic acid cleft is                                   The overall interaction between Fcp1 and Pol II appears dy- <br /> occupied by the DNA template and RNA transcript, which would                                        namic, as tested by gel filtration and affinity pulldown here and <br /> exclude Fcp1 from interacting with Pol II elongation complex,                                       nondenaturing electrophoresis previously (50).

The second mode of interaction seems unlikely                                         icity-based interactions that mediate vital cellular processes, includ- <br /> because the opening above the nucleic acid cleft is occupied by the                                 ing signaling pathways and cell-surface recognitions (59&#226;&#8364;&#8220;61). <br /> upstream DNA strands reannealing in the elongation complex (58); <br /> thus, Fcp1 would be precluded from contacting the elongation                                     <br /> complex. Again, however, Fcp1 was able to stimulate the rate of                                      <br /> elongation of the ternary complex (40).                                                           <br />    Assuming that the third mechanism is true, we speculate that a                                    <br /> closure of the cleft may be caused by Fcp1 interaction with a                                      <br />  <br /> </body></html>
