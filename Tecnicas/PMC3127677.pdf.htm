Drug resistance during C. <br />           dubliniensis infection is common and constitutes a significant therapeutic challenge. The calcineurin <br />           inhibitor FK506 exhibits synergistic fungicidal activity with azoles or echinocandins in the fungal patho- <br />           gens C. albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. In this study, we show that calcineurin <br />           is required for cell wall integrity and wild-type tolerance of C. dubliniensis to azoles and echinocandins; <br />           hence, these drugs are candidates for combination therapy with calcineurin inhibitors. In contrast to C. <br />           albicans, in which the roles of calcineurin and Crz1 in hyphal growth are unclear, here we show that <br />           calcineurin and Crz1 play a clearly demonstrable role in hyphal growth in response to <span id='am-1' about='Thesaurus:Nutrient' typeof='owl:Thing'>nutrient</span> limitation <br />           in C. dubliniensis. We further demonstrate that thigmotropism is controlled by Crz1, but not calcineurin, <br />           in C. dubliniensis.
