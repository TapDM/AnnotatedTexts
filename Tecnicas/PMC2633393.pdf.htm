Nevertheless, replacement of <br /> SEC6 with the patch mutants results in severe temperature-sensitive growth and secretion defects. At nonpermissive <br /> conditions, although trafficking of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane is unimpaired, none of the exocyst subunits <br /> are polarized. This is consistent with data <span id='am-1' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> other exocyst temperature-sensitive mutants, which disrupt the integrity <br /> of the complex. Surprisingly, however, these patch mutations result in mislocalized exocyst complexes that remain intact. <br /> Our results indicate that assembly and polarization of the exocyst are functionally separable events, and that Sec6p is <br /> required to anchor exocyst complexes at sites of secretion. <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                             served oligomeric Golgi), and Dsl1 complexes (Whyte and <br />                                                                          Munro, 2002; Koumandou et al., 2007).

After incubation at permissive (25&#194;&#176;C) or nonpermissive conditions (37&#194;&#176;C), the cells were lysed, and Sec6-HA, sec6-49-HA, or <br /> sec6-54-HA were immunoprecipitated with &#226;&#65533;&#163;-HA antibody. One percent of each input and 10% of each bound sample were loaded on <br /> SDS-PAGE gels for analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation of the exocyst was determined by Western blotting for the individual components. No <br /> binding of the exocyst subunits to the &#226;&#65533;&#163;-HA beads was observed in the untagged control SEC6 strain. Samples for each blot were run on the <br /> same gel, although some differences in mobility between the input and bound protein lanes were observed. Data are representative of four <br /> independent experiments. (B) The exocyst disassembles in a strain containing the sec5-24 ts allele as the sole copy of SEC5. After incubation <br /> at permissive (25&#194;&#176;C) or nonpermissive conditions (37&#194;&#176;C), the cells were lysed, and Sec6-HA was immunoprecipitated.

No binding of the exocyst subunits to the <br /> &#226;&#65533;&#163;-HA beads was observed in the untagged control SEC6 strain. (C) The exocyst does not reassemble after cell lysis. Strains containing either <br /> Sec8-GFP/Sec6p or Sec8-Myc/Sec6-HA were lysed. The lysates were either used individually or mixed, for immunoprecipitation with &#226;&#65533;&#163;-HA <br /> antibody. In the mixed lysate, Sec6-HA coimmunoprecipitates Sec8-Myc (from the same strain), but not Sec8-GFP (from the other strain). (D) <br /> Binding studies using recombinant Sec6p, Sec6-49, and Sec6-54 proteins demonstrate that the Sec6p patch mutants bind Sec8p, Sec10p, and <br /> Exo70p (residues 63-623). Exo84p (residues 523-753) does not bind to Sec6p or either of the mutants above background levels. For Sec10p and <br /> Sec8p binding, MBP-tagged wild-type and mutant Sec6p proteins were used to bind His6-Sec10p and His6-Sec8p. Exo70p and Exo84p were <br /> both tagged with MBP, and binding to His6-tagged wild-type and mutant Sec6p proteins was analyzed.

Conse-               sites of secretion, which was suggested by FRAP data (Boyd <br /> quently, all of the other exocyst subunits are also mislocal-        et al., 2004), is compelling, because the interactions between <br />  <br />  <br /> subunits on the vesicle with those on the plasma membrane                            <br /> could tether the membranes together. If so, then the patch                     <br /> residues of wild-type Sec6p would be necessary to anchor <br /> the complex at these sites after vesicle arrival. In the case of              <br /> the patch mutants, Sec4p would need to hydrolyze the                             <br /> bound GTP, perhaps upon exocyst assembly, to release <br />                                                                                     <br /> Sec15p and therefore the rest of the exocyst complex. On the                         <br /> other hand, it is possible that the exocyst assembles at sites                      <br /> of vesicle formation and budding; the patch residues of                        <br /> Sec6p would be required for proper trafficking of the com-                          <br /> plex to sites of secretion. This could only be the case if                         <br /> vesicles are capable of transport in the absence of assembled                        <br /> exocyst complexes, because trafficking of vesicles containing                        <br /> Sec4p is unimpaired in the patch mutant strains (as well as                        <br /> in the sec6-4 and other exocytic sec mutants). This situation                      <br /> would require that Sec4p on the budding vesicle hydrolyze                        <br /> the bound GTP to release the complex. Further mutational                            <br /> and GFP localization studies will be necessary to distinguish                       <br /> between these scenarios. <br />    Regardless of where assembly takes place, the finding that                       <br /> the complex remains assembled despite a block in exocytosis                         <br /> and in the absence of polarized accumulation suggests two <br /> possibilities. First, the complex cannot disassemble, because                      <br /> disassembly is triggered by a factor(s) at sites of secretion or <br /> by membrane fusion. If the complex is locked into an assem-                     <br /> bled conformation in the sec6-49 and -54 mutants, then it                        <br /> may be unable to be recycled for subsequent rounds of <br />                                                                                   <br /> vesicle tethering and fusion, thus contributing to the ts phe-                   <br /> notype. Alternatively, the complex is assembled in these <br />                                                                                      <br /> mutants because it normally does not disassemble unless                            <br /> destabilized. In this case, mislocalization of the assembled                       <br /> exocyst complexes at nonpermissive conditions would                             <br /> lower the concentration of active exocyst complexes that are                         <br /> available to function at sites of secretion. This would ulti-                 <br /> mately result in decreased SNARE complex assembly and                                <br /> membrane fusion.                                                                    <br />    Conservation of these Sec6p patch residues suggests an                        <br /> important anchoring function for Sec6p in all eukaryotes.                           <br /> Our analyses indicate that the binding partner for the                           <br /> patches on Sec6p is not a subunit of the exocyst complex, nor                         <br /> is it the t-SNARE Sec9p (Figure 5).
