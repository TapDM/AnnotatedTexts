Duplicated SPBs serve as the poles of an intranuclear mitotic <br />         spindle after their insertion into the nuclear envelope in mitosis (Ding et al., Mol. Biol. Cell 8, <br />         1461&#226;&#8364;&#8220;1479). Here, we report the identification and characterization of Schizosaccharomyces pombe <br />         cdc31p, a member of the conserved calcium-binding centrin/CDC31 family. Immunofluorescence <br />         and immunoelectron microscopy show that cdc31p is a SPB component localized at the half- <br />         bridge structure of the SPB. cdc31 is an essential gene and &#226;&#338;&#172;cdc31 cells and cdc31 conditional <br />         mutant cells arrest in mitosis with a monopolar mitotic spindle organized <span id='am-1' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> a single SPB. EM <br />         analysis demonstrates that mutant cdc31 cells fail <span id='am-3' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> duplicate the SPB. In addition, cdc31p exhibits <br />         genetic interactions with the SPB component sad1p and is required for sad1p localization. Finally, <br />         cdc31 mutant can undergo single or multiple rounds of septation before the exit from mitosis, <br />         suggesting that cdc31p activity or SPB duplication may be required for the proper coordination <br />         between the exit from mitosis and the initiation of septation. <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                            envelope called the half-bridge (Byers and Goetsch, 1974; see <br />                                                                         Adams and Kilmartin, 2000 for a review). <br /> To accurately control the segregation of chromosomes be-                   In fission yeast, the SPB is a nuclear-associated organelle <br /> tween sister cells, eukaryotes have developed a very sophis-            composed of a layered cytoplasmic part and an electron <br /> ticated apparatus, the mitotic spindle.

An <br /> microtubules are most often focused on two poles organized              electron dense particle, lying on the nuclear envelope beside <br /> by a specialized organelle, the centrosome. This organelle,             the layered cytoplasmic part of the SPB, has been proposed <br /> which both nucleates and anchors microtubule (MTs), du-                 to be analogous to budding yeast half-bridge. Fission yeast <br /> plicates only once in a cell cycle. During duplication, new             SPB duplication is thought to occur in the cytoplasm in late <br /> centrosomal structures usually appear in close vicinity to the          G2 when the single SPB structure is replaced by two smaller <br /> preexisting ones. In animal cells for instance, new centrioles          structures connected by an electron dense bridge. No inter- <br /> form perpendicularly to the proximal end of the preexisting             mediate state in SPB duplication such as the formation of a <br /> pair of centrioles. This feature is also true for budding yeast         satellite has been described to date.
