SYS3 encodes a 105-kDa protein with a pre- <br />         dicted high a-helical content. It is related <span id='am-6' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> a variety of mammalian Golgi-associated <br />         proteins and to the yeast Uso1p, an essential protein involved in docking of endoplasmic <br />         reticulum&#226;&#8364;&#8220; derived vesicles to the cis-Golgi. Like Uso1p, Sys3p is predominatly cytosolic. <br />         According to gel chromatographic, two-hybrid, and chemical cross-linking analyses, <br />         Sys3p forms dimers and larger protein complexes. Its loss of function results in partial <br />         missorting of carboxypeptidase Y. Double disruptions of SYS3 and YPT6 lead to a <br />         significant growth inhibition of the mutant cells, to a massive accumulation of 40- to <br />         50-nm vesicles, to an aggravation of vacuolar protein missorting, and to a defect in <br />         a-pheromone processing apparently attributable to a perturbation of protease Kex2p <br />         cycling between the Golgi and a post-Golgi compartment. The results of this study <br />         suggest that Sys3p, like Ypt6p, acts in vesicular transport (presumably at a vesicle- <br />         docking stage) between an endosomal compartment and the most distal Golgi compart- <br />         ment. <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                           One of the small GTP-binding proteins, Ypt6p of <br />                                                                     Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a homologue of the mamma- <br /> Vesicular transport of proteins and lipids is mediated              lian Rab6p, is supposed to have a Golgi-associated <br /> by a number of soluble and membrane-associated pro-                 function. In contrast to the Ypt/Rab GTPases acting at <br /> teins that are required for vesicle formation and their             various steps of the secretory pathway (Ypt1p, Ypt31/ <br /> docking to and fusion with specific target membranes.               32p, and Sec4p), Ypt6p is not essential for yeast cell <br /> Of these proteins, small GTPases of the Ypt/Rab fam-                viability. However, the deletion of the YPT6 gene or a <br /> ily act as major regulators most likely in the vesicle-             specific truncation of the C-terminal two-thirds of <br /> docking process. At steady state, they are mostly lo-               Ypt6p resulted in temperature sensitivity of the re- <br /> calized to the surface of distinct subcompartments of               spective mutant cells. <span id='am-3' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>From</span> studies with different ypt6 <br /> the exocytotic and endocytotic pathways, and they                   mutants and multicopy suppressors of their tempera- <br /> cycle between a GTP-bound, active and GDP-bound,                    ture-sensitive phenotypes, it has been concluded that <br /> inactive conformation (Lazar et al., 1997; Novick and               Ypt6p has a function in secretion (Li and Warner, <br /> Zerial, 1997; Schimmo&#194;&#168;ller et al., 1998).                           1996) or in transport between the late Golgi and a <br />                                                                     prevacuolar, endosome-like compartment (Tsukada <br />                                                                     and Gallwitz, 1996). <br />   * Present address: Department of Dermatology, University Med- <br />     ical Center Benjamin Franklin, The Free University of Berlin, <br />                                                                        We previously reported on the isolation of four <br />     D-1220 Berlin, Germany.                                         yeast genes, termed SYS1, SYS2, SYS3, and SYS5, that <br />   &#226;&#8364;&#160; <br />     Corresponding author.
