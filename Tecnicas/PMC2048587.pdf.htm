However, the function of this factor remains <span id='am-7' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> be elucidated. In this study, <br />                                 we investigated the developmental roles of Lrrc10 using zebrafish as an animal model. Knockdown <br />                                 of Lrrc10 in zebrafish embryos (morphants) using morpholinos caused severe cardiac morphogenic <br />                                 defects including a cardiac looping failure accompanied by a large pericardial edema, and embryonic <br />                                 lethality between day 6 and 7 post fertilization. The Lrrc10 morphants exhibited cardiac functional <br />                                 defects as evidenced by a decrease in ejection fraction and cardiac output. Further investigations into <br />                                 the underlying mechanisms of the cardiac defects revealed that the number of cardiomyocyte was <br />                                 reduced in the morphants. Expression of two cardiac genes was deregulated in the morphants <br />                                 including an increase in atrial natriuretic factor, a hallmark for cardiac hypertrophy and failure, and <br />                                 a decrease in cardiac myosin light chain 2, an essential protein for cardiac contractility in zebrafish. <br />                                 Moreover, a reduced fluorescence intensity <span id='am-5' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> NADH in the morphant heart was observed in live <br />                                 zebrafish embryos as compared to control. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that Lrrc10 <br />                                 is necessary for normal cardiac development and cardiac function in zebrafish embryos, which will <br />                                 enhance our understanding of congenital heart defects and heart disease. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                            Keywords <br />                                 Leucine-rich Repeat Containing protein 10; Heart development; Cardiac function; Zebrafish <br />                                 embryos; Cardiac looping defects; Pericardial edema <br />  <br />  <br />                            Introduction <br />                                             Identification of molecular pathways involved in normal heart development will lead to the <br />                                             discovery of the genetic basis for human congenital heart disease as well as adult cardiac <br />                                             disease.

Cardiac development is a complex biological <br />                                         process requiring the integration of cell specification, differentiation, and morphogenesis. <br />                                         Many factors have been implicated in this process on the basis of their spatial and temporal <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         expression patterns or their phenotypic effects when they are functionally inactivated in various <br />                                         animal models. These include diverse families of transcription factors, including Nkx2.5 <br />                                         (Lyons et al., 1995; Schott et al., 1998), GATA4 (Kuo et al., 1997; Molkentin et al., 1997), <br />                                         Tbx5, and Tbx20 (Bruneau et al., 2001; Krause et al., 2004; Stennard et al., 2005), and Jumonji/ <br />                                         Jarid2, (Jung et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2000), and Fog-1 (Walton et al., 2006). In addition, secreted <br />                                         factors with their receptors (Bujak and Frangogiannis, 2006; Schneider et al., 2003), and <br />                                         cytoplasmic and contractile proteins (Bendig et al., 2006; Berdougo et al., 2003; Rottbauer et <br />                                         al., 2006) have been shown to be critical for cardiac development. However, the exact <br />                                         molecular mechanisms of embryonic cardiac development remain to be elucidated. <br />  <br />                                         Therefore, we reasoned that there are yet unidentified cardiac factors that play critical roles in <br />                                         normal heart development as well as in maintaining normal cardiac function in adults. We have <br />                                         identified a mouse gene encoding Leucine-rich Repeat Containing protein 10 (LRRC10) as a <br />                                         cardiac-specific gene by employing in silico approaches (Passier et al., 2000; Wang et al., <br />                                         2001), which exhibits dynamic expression patterns during development (Kim et al., in press). <br />                                         While we were characterizing this factor in zebrafish, LRRC10 was reported as a cardiac- <br />                                         restricted (HRLRRP) or cardiac-specific factor (SERDIN1) in mice (Adameyko et al., 2005; <br />                                         Nakane et al., 2004). Herein, we will refer to this gene as LRRC10 in accordance with the <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         NCBI nomenclature. However, the developmental and molecular function of LRRC10 remains <br />                                         completely unknown. <br />  <br />                                         Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs are present in an increasing number of proteins with diverse <br />                                         functions such as enzyme inhibition, cell growth, cell adhesion, signal transduction, regulation <br />                                         of gene expression, apoptosis signaling, and development (Kobe and Kajava, 2001). LRR <br />                                         motifs are present in over 2000 proteins from viruses to eukaryotes. LRRs are 20&#226;&#8364;&#8220;29 residue <br />                                         sequence motifs and the repeat number ranges from 2 to 45. The primary function of these <br />                                         motifs is believed to provide a structural framework for protein&#226;&#8364;&#8220;protein interactions. Mouse <br />                                         and human LRRC10 contain seven LRR motifs and do not contain any N-terminal or C- <br />                                         terminal domains that are often present in other LRRC proteins (Fig. 1B). These additional <br />                                         domains seem to confer specific functions to LRRC proteins such as a kinase domain or a <br />                                         membrane spanning domain (Buchanan and Gay, 1996). Therefore, the LRRC10 gene product <br />                                         represents a unique member of the LRRC protein family, which contains only the leucine-rich <br />                                         repeat motif. The LRRC10 gene is conserved in most vertebrates including mouse, rat, human, <br />                                         chicken, and frog, suggesting an important function in an evolutionally conserved manner. <br />                                         Therefore, we set out to identify the roles of Lrrc10 in cardiac development using zebrafish <br />                                         (Danio rerio) as a vertebrate model. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         The zebrafish has become a popular model for the study of cardiovascular development. It <br />                                         presents a prototypic vertebrate heart with only a single atrium and ventricle. The molecular <br />                                         mechanisms governing its patterning appear to be similar to those in more complex hearts of <br />                                         higher vertebrates (Fishman and Chien, 1997; Weinstein and Fishman, 1996). Assessing early <br />                                         embryonic heart morphology and function is facilitated in zebrafish embryos because they are <br />                                         transparent and not dependent on intact cardiovascular function during the first 6&#226;&#8364;&#8220;7 days of <br />                                         development (Pelster and Burggren, 1996). The heart is the first definitive organ to develop <br />                                         and become functional as <span id='am-8' about='Thesaurus:TESSE01' typeof='owl:Thing'><span id='am-9'

However, there is a period <br />                                         when the heart is already functional, but not yet essential in the early developmental stages. In <br />                                         the zebrafish embryos, this period actually lasts for several days because of the small size and <br />                                         relatively low metabolism.

The remarkable cardiac-specific expression of lrrc10 was observed <br />                                           in zebrafish. To identify the developmental roles of Lrrc10, Lrrc10 expression was reduced <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           using lrrc10-specific antisense morpholinos. Knockdown of Lrrc10 caused early <br />                                           morphological defects such as cardiac looping defects accompanied by a large pericardial <br />                                           edema, suggesting cardiac insufficiency. In addition, defects in cardiac function were observed <br />                                           as evidenced by decreased ejection fraction and cardiac output. Further investigations into the <br />                                           underlying mechanisms of the cardiac defects indicated that the number of cardiomyocytes <br />                                           was reduced in the morphants. In addition, expression of important cardiac genes was <br />                                           deregulated in the morphants such as atrial natriuretic factor, a hallmark for cardiac failure, <br />                                           and cardiac myosin light chain 2, an essential protein for cardiac contractility. In addition, a <br />                                           reduced amount of NADH in the morphant heart was observed in live zebrafish embryos as <br />                                           compared to control, suggesting a decrease in energy reserve due to Lrrc10 reduction. The <br />                                           results presented here indicate that Lrrc10 is essential for early cardiac development and <br />                                           function in zebrafish embryos. Therefore, this study will provide a critical foundation to further <br />                                           study the biological functions of Lrrc10 in cardiomyocytes, which will enhance our <br />                                           understanding of the mechanisms that lead to normal cardiac development and function. <br />  <br />                               Materials and methods <br />                               Zebrafish maintenance <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           A cmlc2:dsRed2-nuc line of transgenic zebrafish (AB background) that expresses red <br />                                           fluorescent protein (RFP) specifically in the cardiomyocyte nucleus was used to determine the <br />                                           number of cardiac myocytes. A transgenic cmlc2::GFP zebrafish line (AB background) that <br />                                           marks cardiomyocytes with Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) was used to visualize the <br />                                           abnormal contractions as described below (see Movies S1 and S2). The wild type AB strain <br />                                           of zebrafish was used for all other experiments. Pooled embryos from group matings were used <br />                                           in all experiments to control for variability between different clutches of embryos. All fish <br />                                           were bred and embryos were raised according to the procedures as described elsewhere <br />                                           (Westerfield, 1995). When applicable, fish were anesthetized with 1.67 mg/ml tricaine <br />                                           (Sigma). <br />  <br />                               Cloning of a full-<span id='am-6' about='xsp:length' typeof='owl:Thing'>length</span> zebrafish lrrc10 cDNA <br />                                           To identify novel cardiac-specific genes that are exclusively expressed in the heart, we <br />                                           performed a virtual subtractive screen (in silico approach) as described previously (Adameyko <br />                                           et al., 2005; Nakane et al., 2004; Passier et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2001). Mouse Expression <br />                                           Sequence Tag (EST) databases from embryonic day (E)13 heart were searched using the NCBI <br />                                           database. By subtracting genes that are expressed in other organs, we identified a list of putative <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           cardiac-specific genes. These genes were subsequently subjected to in situ hybridization and <br />                                           Northern blot analyses to examine the expression patterns. From this expression screening, a <br />                                           mouse gene encoding Leucine-rich Repeat Containing protein 10 (LRRC10) was identified as <br />                                           a cardiac-specific gene (Kim et al., in press). <br />  <br />                                           Zebrafish lrrc10 (zlrrc10) was cloned by RT-PCR using gene specific primers based on the <br />                                           reported zlrrc10 cDNA sequence, forward (F) 5&#226;&#8364;&#178;-ACAGGAGCATCAAACACCA and reverse <br />                                           (R) 5&#226;&#8364;&#178;-ACAAAAGTCACTAATTCACTC (Genbank nucleotide accession number; <br />                                           GI57222256).

After 90 min incubation at 30 &#194;&#176;C radioactive translation products were resolved by <br />                                           10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. <br />  <br />                                           The microinjection (Narishige IM300 Microinjector) of newly fertilized eggs was preformed <br />                                           at the 1&#226;&#8364;&#8220;2 cell stages with approximately 2 nl of the appropriate morpholino solution (0.15 <br />                                           mM of zlrrc10-MO1, CMO or CMO-5m) (Antkiewicz et al., 2006). For MO2 injections, we <br />                                           used 0.75 mM of zlrrc10-MO2 or CMO. 1&#195;&#8212; Danieau&apos;s solution (58 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM KCl, <br />                                           0.4 mM MgSO4, 0.6 mM Ca(NO3)2, 5 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine-N&apos;-2-ethane- <br />                                           sulfonic acid, pH 7.6) was used to dilute all morpholino stocks to the concentration appropriate <br />                                           for injection. The morpholino solution was injected approximately at the border between the <br />                                           cell and yolk, with a needle positioned such that it was piercing the cell. Embryos were screened <br />                                           under fluorescent light to determine injection success and even distribution of morpholino <br />                                           within the embryo at approximately 2 h postinjection. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                               Whole-mount in situ hybridization, immunostaining, and histology <br />                                           To study the expression of zlrrc10, anf and cmlc2 mRNA in zebrafish embryos, pCRII-TOPO- <br />                                           zlrrc10 and pCRII-TOPO-anf plasmid were cloned. cmlc2 was a kind gift from Dr. Randall <br />                                           Peterson. To clone the partial anf cDNA, RT-PCR was performed using total RNA from the <br />                                           zebrafish adult heart with the following pairs of oligonucleotide primer sequences: anf: F 5&#226;&#8364;&#178;- <br />                                           ACACGTTGAGCAGACACAGC, R 5&#226;&#8364;&#178;-TGTTAACAAATTAAGCCGTATTGT. <br />  <br />                                           Whole-mount in situ hybridization of zebrafish embryos was carried out by using <br />                                           digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled probes (Roche Diagnostics Corp) as previously described (Yelon <br />                                           et al., 1999). The antisense probes for full-length zlrrc10, anf, and cmlc2 were synthesized by <br />                                           linearizing their respective plasmids with NotI and using Sp6 RNA polymerase. The sense <br />                                           probe for zlrrc10 was synthesized for negative control by linearizing the pCRII-TOPO- <br />  <br />  <br />                                                 Dev Biol.

To quantitatively analyze the <br />                                           differences of gene expression, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed. Briefly, following <br />                                           first-strand cDNA synthesis, PCR amplifications were performed with 2% of the first-strand <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           reaction, 1 <span id='am-2' about='Thesaurus:Unit' typeof='owl:Thing'>unit</span> of Taq polymerase (Denville Scientific Inc, Metuchen, NJ), and 25 pmol of the <br />                                           appropriate primers in a reaction volume of 25 &#206;&#188;l. The amplification was done at 94 &#194;&#176;C for 1 <br />                                           min followed by 24 cycles of 94 &#194;&#176;C for 30 s, annealing at 55 &#194;&#176;C for 30 s, and extension at 72 <br />                                           &#194;&#176;C for 30 s. A final extension at 72 &#194;&#176;C for 7 min was performed. Gene-specific primers for <br />                                           cmlc2 are F 5&#226;&#8364;&#178;-ACCGGGATGGAGTTATCA, and R 5&#226;&#8364;&#178;-CTCCTGTGGCATTAGGG. The <br />                                           authenticity of the amplified products was determined by size analysis on agarose gels. <br />  <br />                                           Immunostaining of zebrafish embryos was performed as previously described (Berdougo et <br />                                           al., 2003) using the monoclonal antibody MF20 that recognizes the myosin heavy chain <br />                                           (MHC). Briefly, embryos fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde were dehydrated in a methanol series. <br />                                           For staining, rehydrated embryos were permeabilized by digestion in collagnase (1 mg/ml) for <br />                                           30&#226;&#8364;&#8220;40 min. Permeabilized larvae were blocked in 10% normal calf serum in PBS with 0.1% <br />                                           Tween-20 for 1 h. After overnight incubation with the MF20 antibody, embryos were incubated <br />                                           with a secondary antibody (Alexa-546 conjugated goat anti-mouse, Molecular Probes, OR, <br />                                           USA) for 5 h at room temperature and visualized by epifluorescence microscopy. <br />  <br />                                           Histological experiments were performed by standard hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&amp;E) <br />                                           as previously described (Lee et al., 2000).

Paraffin embedded embryos <br />                                           were sectioned at 10 &#206;&#188;m thickness and stained with H&amp;E to examine histology of the heart. <br />  <br />                               Red blood cell (RBC) perfusion rate and analyses of the number of cardiac myocytes <br />                                           As an index of regional blood flow, RBC perfusion rate was measured in one readily <br />                                           identifiable vessel, the intersegmental blood vessel (ISV) in the tail as described elsewhere <br />                                           (Trumpp et al., 2001). Embryos were mounted in 3% methyl cellulose (Sigma) and high-speed <br />                                           video time-lapse recordings (125 frames per second) were used to image RBCs passing through <br />                                           an ISV of the mounted zebrafish in a 3 s period. These recordings were captured using a Motion <br />                                           Scope camera (Redlake) and a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope with a 10&#195;&#8212; lens. The total <br />                                           number of RBCs passing through an ISV during the entire recording was counted. <br />  <br />                                           Cardiac myocytes were counted at 3 and 4 days post fertilization (dpf) in cmlc2::dsRed2-nuc <br />                                           transgenic zebrafish (Antkiewicz et al., 2005; Mably et al., 2003) using the method described <br />                                           by Antkiewicz et al. (2005). Briefly, embryos were anesthetized and flat-mounted on a glass <br />                                           microscope slide under a coverslip in Lebovitz&apos;s L15 cell culture media (Invitrogen). <br />                                           Epifluorescence images were captured using the Nikon TE300 inverted microscope (20&#195;&#8212; lens) <br />                                           and a Princeton Instruments Micromax charge-coupled device camera.

Briefly, frames representative of the ventricle <br />                                           in end-systole and end-diastole were used to calculate volume of the ventricle for both states <br />                                           according to the method of discs (Coucelo et al., 2000). This method assumes that ventricular <br />                                           volume can be represented as the sum of the volumes of individual discs into which the ventricle <br />                                           can be sliced. The two-dimensional image of the ventricle at end-diastole and end-systole was <br />                                           divided into slices of 10 &#206;&#188;m thickness and their volume was assessed using the MetaMorph <br />                                           Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corporation).

Stroke volume (SV) was calculated from <br />                                            the approximated EDV and ESV: SV=EDV&#226;&#8364;&#8220;ESV; cardiac output (CO)=SV&#195;&#8212;HR. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                               Multiphoton fluorescence imaging <br />                                            NADH is an intrinsically fluorescent molecule, which allows one to monitor NADH <br />                                            fluorescence to dynamically interpret the metabolic activity in vivo (Chance et al., 1962; <br />                                            Pappajohn et al., 1972). NADH images of the heart in live zebrafish embryos were collected <br />                                            with a purpose-built multiphoton imaging system (LOCI at the University of Wisconsin, <br />                                            Madison) (Bird et al., 2004; Bird et al., 2005). Briefly, a titanium sapphire laser (Coherent, <br />                                            Mira) tuned to wavelength at 780 nm excitation was the two-photon excitation source. The <br />                                            excitation light was sent to and the emitted light was collected from the sample through an <br />                                            inverted microscope (Nikon, TE2000U) with a 40&#195;&#8212; objective (Nikon, PlanApo NA 1.4) <br />                                            coupled to a laboratory-developed laser scanning system. Synchronized fluorescence data <br />                                            collection on a pixel-by-pixel basis was achieved using the x and y laser scanning signals <br />                                            generated for the laser scanning electronics. Acquisition was done with WiscScan, a laboratory- <br />                                            developed acquisition package (Bird et al., 2004). <br />  <br />                               Statistical analyses <br />                                            One-way analysis of variance followed by the Fisher least significant difference test was used <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            to determine statistical significance. The assumption of unequal variances for all data sets was <br />                                            checked using Levene&apos;s test.

All analyses were <br />                                            performed using the Statistica 7.0 software package. In all cases, the observer was blinded to <br />                                            the treatment group until measurements or scoring was completed. <br />  <br />                               Results <br />                               Examination of zlrrc10 expression patterns <br />                                            Information on the detailed expression patterns of a gene provides an important basis for <br />                                            understanding the biological roles of the gene product. Due to the remarkable cardiac-specific <br />                                            expression of LRRC10 in mouse (Adameyko et al., 2005; Nakane et al., 2004) (Kim et al., in <br />                                            press) and human (data not shown, 2007), we set out to determine whether Lrrc10 plays critical <br />                                            roles in cardiac development in the zebrafish embryo. It presents a prototypic vertebrate heart <br />                                            because the molecular mechanisms regulating cardiac development in zebrafish appear to be <br />                                            similar to those in more complex hearts of higher vertebrates (Weinstein and Fishman, 1996; <br />                                            Fishman and Chien, 1997). <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            In preparation for investigating the developmental roles of Lrrc10, we first examined the <br />                                            expression patterns of zlrrc10 in zebrafish embryos by whole-mount in situ hybridization using <br />                                            an antisense zlrrc10 probe (Fig. 1). The full-length cDNA consisting of the coding sequence <br />                                            and 5&#226;&#8364;&#178; and 3&#226;&#8364;&#178; untranslated regions of zlrrc10 was cloned by RT-PCR as described in Materials <br />                                            and methods section. The full-length zlrrc10 cDNA is encoded by two exons as depicted in <br />                                            Fig. 1A whereas the mouse LRRC10 is encoded by one exon. The coding sequence of zLrrc10 <br />                                            contains 270 amino acids, which is highly homologous to the mouse and human LRRC10, <br />                                            suggesting the conserved function of this gene product (Fig. 1B). The primary amino acid <br />                                            sequence of zLrrc10 is 62% or 64% identical to the mouse or human LRRC10, respectively. <br />                                            If the similar amino acids are included, the homology is 73% or 76% to the mouse or human <br />                                            LRRC10, respectively. The zLrrc10 consists of seven LRR motifs without any known <br />                                            functional domain as in mouse and human LRRC10. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                  Dev Biol.

Page 7 <br />  <br />  <br />                                          To perform whole-mount in situ hybridization, zebrafish cardiac myosin light chain 2 <br />                                          (cmlc2) was used as a positive cardiac marker gene to visualize the developing heart (Fig. 1C, <br />                                          b and e). It has been demonstrated that cmlc2 is expressed both in the embryonic ventricle and <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                          atrium of zebrafish (Rottbauer et al., 2006; Yelon et al., 1999). lrrc10 in zebrafish was detected <br />                                          specifically, but weakly in the linear heart tube of 1 dpf embryos followed by a marked increase <br />                                          in the heart of 2 dpf embryos (Fig. 1C, a and d). zlrrc10 expression appears to be higher in the <br />                                          ventricle than the atrium, but it should be noted that the atrium contains fewer cardiomyocytes <br />                                          than the ventricle. zlrrc10 was not detected in any other tissues or organs in developing <br />                                          embryos. The negative control using a sense-zlrrc10 probe did not show any staining (Fig. 1C, <br />                                          c and f), indicating specificity of the antisense zlrrc10 probe. The cardiac-specific expression <br />                                          continues in adult zebrafish as indicated by RT-PCR assays. The zlrrc10 transcripts were <br />                                          detected only in the heart, but not in the head or tail region of adult zebrafish (Fig. 1D). These <br />                                          results demonstrate the cardiac-specific expression of lrrc10 in zebrafish from 1 dpf to adult. <br />  <br />                               Examination of morpholinos <br />                                          To determine whether Lrrc10 plays critical roles in cardiac development, we performed <br />                                          antisense morpholino (MO) experiments during early zebrafish development. Zebrafish are <br />                                          well suited for gene function studies using MOs due to their rapid external development, <br />                                          transparent embryos, and the ease of delivery of the intervening MOs. We designed <br />                                          morpholinos against the translation initiation site in zlrrc10 mRNA to reduce Lrrc10 protein <br />                                          level in zebrafish embryos. The ability of morpholinos to block translation of zlrrc10 was <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                          examined using an in vitro translation reaction in the absence or presence of morpholino (Fig. <br />                                          2A). In vitro translated and [35S]-methionine labeled Lrrc10 was detected as a single band at <br />                                          the expected size of 31 kDa (indicated by +). MO1 completely blocked translation of zlrrc10 <br />                                          at 0.26 &#206;&#188;M whereas the control morpholino (CMO) did not inhibit translation even at a higher <br />                                          concentration of 1.3 &#206;&#188;M. MOs display sequence-specific inhibition over a wide concentration <br />                                          range: 3&#226;&#8364;&#8220;3000 nM in cell-free translation systems (Sumanas and Larson, 2002). To further <br />                                          confirm the specificity of MO1, we tested MO1 containing five mismatched base pairs <br />                                          (CMO-5m) as an additional specific negative control. CMO-5m did not block translation of <br />                                          zlrrc10, indicating the specific effect of MO1 on blocking translation of zlrrc10. <br />  <br />                                          It is important to use stringent negative controls for antisense experiments. While MOs can <br />                                          exhibit specific inhibition over a wide concentration range, non-specific interactions still <br />                                          happen, especially at higher doses. One likely reason for the possible non-specific effects is <br />                                          mistargeting. While random sequences of MOs are widely used as a control for general toxicity <br />                                          of MOs, and embryo handling, it does not address MO mistargeting, which is the likely cause <br />                                          of non-specific phenotypes. It becomes necessary to confirm the specificity of novel <br />                                          phenotypes either by RNA rescue or by using another MO of different sequence targeted against <br />                                          the same gene. RNA rescue is often complicated due to RNA overexpression artifacts and the <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                          inability to mimic the endogenous spatial and temporal gene expression <span id='am-243' about='xsp:pattern' typeof='owl:Thing'>pattern</span> that is often <br />                                          critical for the proper function of the gene. This is the case for rescue experiments for Lrrc10 <br />                                          knockdown embryos because zlrrc10 is a cardiac-specific gene. However, the mistargeting <br />                                          issue is well addressed when two MOs of different sequence against the same gene produce <br />                                          the same phenotype. Therefore, we synthesized a different zlrrc10 morpholino, MO2, which <br />                                          also blocked the translation of zlrrc10 in vitro, but to a much lesser extent than MO1 (Fig. 2A). <br />                                          MO2 blocked the translation with about 90% efficiency at 3 &#206;&#188;M while CMO did not (data not <br />                                          shown). Having confirmed the specific activity of zlrrc10 morpholinos in blocking translation <br />                                          in vitro, we generated the Lrrc10 knockdown embryos to examine the developmental roles of <br />                                          Lrrc10. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                Dev Biol.

The zlrrc10-MO1 knockdown embryos (morphants) did not show <br />                                          gross abnormalities at 1 dpf (data not shown). In normal zebrafish embryos, by 26 h post <br />                                          fertilization (hpf), the heart tube is formed and elongated to form an asymmetrically located <br />                                          tube, which then undergoes looping (Heideman et al., 2005). At about 36 hpf, the ventricular <br />                                          cells move to the right of the atrium in a process known as rightward looping, which lasts until <br />                                          approximately 48 hpf. Initially peristaltic waves of contraction in the simple heart drive <br />                                          circulation, beginning approximately 24 hpf. After 48 hpf, much of the basic architecture of <br />                                          the heart has formed, and a process of maturation continues in which the myocardial walls <br />                                          thicken and become trabeculated and actual valve leaflets form. <br />  <br />                                          However, starting at 2 dpf, the zlrrc10 morphants exhibited gross abnormalities including a <br />                                          large pericardial edema and cardiac looping defects. The representative images of control (a <br />                                          and d) and the morphants (b, c, e and f) at 3 dpf are shown in Fig. 2B. The zlrrc10 morphants <br />                                          showed a large pericardial edema that was readily apparent (indicated by arrow Fig. 2B, b and <br />                                          c) that is absent in control (Fig. 2B, a), suggesting cardiac insufficiency. We did not observe <br />                                          any significant general toxicity in the control embryos (Fig. 2B, a). Because the heart has <br />                                          undergone looping in the control embryos, the ventricle and atrium of the control embryos are <br />                                          overlapped and not distinguishable by the lateral view (Fig. 2B, d). In contrast, the zlrrc10 <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                          morphants exhibited prominent looping defects at higher magnification as shown by two <br />                                          representative morphants (Fig. 2B, e and f). Most zlrrc10 morphants showed a complete <br />                                          looping failure, resulting in the linear heart with a stretched <span id='am-4' about='xsd:string' typeof='owl:Thing'>string</span>-like atrium (Fig. 2B, e) or <br />                                          a round atrium (Fig. 2B, f). Some zlrrc10 morphants showed a partially looped heart (see Fig. <br />                                          3G). <br />  <br />                                          We analyzed the morphants daily and the results from four independent microinjection <br />                                          experiments are summarized in Table 1. The looping defect persisted and pericardial edema <br />                                          became progressively larger, suggesting severe cardiac insufficiency. By 4 dpf, about 90% of <br />                                          morphants showed looping defects with a large pericardial edema. The morphology of the <br />                                          ventricle in the morphants became abnormal by 4 dpf, as shown by it being compact and small <br />                                          compared to that of control embryos (see Fig. 3). <br />  <br />                                          The tubular hearts in the morphants were able to contract and drive the circulation, but not as <br />                                          effectively as the control heart as evidenced by markedly slower moving blood cells in the <br />                                          ISVs (Fig. 2C). The number of blood cells passing through ISV in the tail caudal to the yolk <br />                                          was significantly decreased in the morphants. As early as 36 hpf, heart contractions appeared <br />                                          visibly abnormal or incomplete in zlrrc10 morphants, and this continued to be abnormal during <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                          development (Supplemental data provided by a movie using a transgenic zebrafish line <br />                                          cmlc2::GFP). In contrast, vigorous contractions were observed in control embryos. These <br />                                          results led us to analyze the cardiac function as described below (Fig. 4). Although the <br />                                          morphology of the heart was abnormal and cardiac function appeared defective, the morphants <br />                                          survived until 6&#226;&#8364;&#8220;7 dpf when viability in the morphant started to deteriorate, as indicated by <br />                                          either no heart beat or a very weak heart beat. <br />  <br />                                          To confirm that the effect of MO1 on cardiac development is caused by knockdown of Lrrc10, <br />                                          rather than non-specific effect due to mistargeting, zlrrc10-MO2 that is targeted at a different <br />                                          site was tested. As summarized in Table 1, MO2 injection also caused cardiac looping defects <br />                                          and pericardial edema in the morphants, which is the same phenotype by MO1 injection. <br />                                          Cardiac looping defects persisted during the course of examination, which were observed in <br />                                          about 80% of the MO2 morphants (Table 1). A large pericardial edema was observed in up to <br />                                          66% of the MO2 morphants at 3 dpf followed by recovery at 4 and 5 dpf, suggesting cardiac <br />  <br />  <br />                                                Dev Biol.

Page 9 <br />  <br />  <br />                                           function was improved as the morphants developed. It should be noted that MO2 blocks <br />                                           translation much less efficiently than MO1 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, it is highly likely that the <br />                                           effect of MO2 is reduced because the concentration of MO is diluted as embryos develop and <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           the level of zLrrc10 expression increases as the heart develops (Fig. 1C, a and b; data not <br />                                           shown, 2007). In fact, it is believed that MOs are most efficient during the first 2 or 3 days of <br />                                           development, possibly due to dilution by ongoing cell divisions and by elimination from the <br />                                           embryo body due to metabolism and excretion of the MO (Sumanas and Larson, 2002). <br />                                           Nevertheless, it is interesting that the MO2 morphants with abnormal cardiac morphologies at <br />                                           4&#226;&#8364;&#8220;5 dpf seem to have improved cardiac function. We have not observed any defects in other <br />                                           regions of the morphants injected with MO1 or MO2, indicating the cardiac-specific effects <br />                                           of zlrrc10 MOs. In addition, neither scrambled control morpholino (CMO) nor CMO-5m <br />                                           caused any significant morphological defects, which indicates the specific effects of zlrrc10 <br />                                           MOs on Lrrc10 knockdown. Therefore, these results demonstrate that Lrrc10 is a critical factor <br />                                           for early cardiac development and suggest cardiac functional defects in the zlrrc10 morphants. <br />  <br />                               Histology of the heart is abnormal in the zlrrc10 morphant <br />                                           The zebrafish embryos were sectioned and stained with H&amp;E to analyze histology of the heart <br />                                           at 3 (results not shown) and 4 dpf (Fig. 3). By 48 hpf, the beginning of valve formation is <br />                                           evident as endocardial cells at the AV junction become distinct in morphology and gene <br />                                           expression, as they begin to form valve cushions. Blood flow is a critical factor in valve <br />                                           formation, and blocked circulation prevents proper valve development (Bartman et al., <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           2004;Hove et al., 2003). After 48 hpf, the zebrafish heart consists of a smooth-walled tube <br />                                           partitioned into all four segments with the definite structure of sinus venosus, atrium, ventricle, <br />                                           and bulbus arteriosus (Grimes et al., 2006;Hu et al., 2000). Each part is externally identified <br />                                           by a constriction between the segments. The myocardium is about one cell thickness in the <br />                                           atrium, but the ventricle has two to three cell layers. The heart is lined with endocardium, <br />                                           separated from the myocardium by a layer of cardiac jelly in the atrium. The ventricle and sinus <br />                                           venosus do not have a cardiac jelly layer. There are no valves separating the segments at this <br />                                           stage. <br />  <br />                                           At 4 dpf, the zlrrc10 MO1 morphants showed similar abnormalities to the 3 dpf morphants. <br />                                           The position and morphology of the bulbus arteriosus in the morphants seemed normal <br />                                           (compare Figs. 3A and E). Two to three layers of cardiomyocytes were observed in the <br />                                           ventricles of both the morphants (Figs. 3F and G) and control (Figs. 3B and C). However, <br />                                           prominent morphological defects were observed in the ventricle of the zlrrc10 morphant, which <br />                                           was small and compact compared to the control. The AV valve that is forming seemed normal <br />                                           at the AV canal that was normally constricted (compare Figs. 3C and G). The looping defect <br />                                           in the zlrrc10 morphant was clearly evident as shown in Fig. 3G, where the atrium was located <br />                                           laterally as opposed to dorsally in the control. This particular embryo has undergone a partial <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           looping process since the atrium was observed with the ventricle at the same plane of section. <br />                                           A cross-section of the stretched, string-like atrium was striking in the zlrrc10 morphant as <br />                                           compared to the control (compare Figs. 3D and H). In both control and the morphant, the atrial <br />                                           wall consisted of one myocardial layer and the endocardial layer with space for cardiac jelly <br />                                           in between. The impressive pericardial edema (indicated by an arrowhead) was evident in all <br />                                           transverse sections of the morphant heart. These results clearly demonstrate cardiac looping <br />                                           defects and suggest possible defective cardiac chamber growth when Lrrc10 expression is <br />                                           reduced. <br />  <br />                               Knockdown of zLrrc10 resulted in cardiac functional defects <br />                                           In addition to defective cardiac morphogenesis, the heart of zlrrc10 morphants exhibited <br />                                           abnormal contraction. Vigorous peristaltic contraction waves traversing the heart tube were <br />                                           usually observed in wild type embryos by 36 hpf. In contrast, the heart of the morphant seemed <br />  <br />  <br />                                                 Dev Biol.

Since normal morphological development is critical for normal cardiac <br />                                           function, we investigated the cardiac function as described in Materials and methods. End- <br />                                           diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) were measured for the beating heart <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           (Fig. 4A). EDV was decreased in the zlrrc10 morphants during the period of 3&#226;&#8364;&#8220;5 dpf as <br />                                           compared to the control heart. The decrease in EDV was prominent in the morphants at 5 dpf. <br />                                           In contrast, ESV in the morphant does not seem to differ from that of control. Accordingly, <br />                                           stroke volume and ejection fraction were significantly reduced in the morphants, especially at <br />                                           5 dpf as compared to control during the course of study (Figs. 4B and C). Heart rate was also <br />                                           significantly decreased in the morphants compared to control (Fig. 4D). As a consequence of <br />                                           the reduced stroke volume and heart rate, cardiac output was markedly reduced (Fig. 4E), which <br />                                           led to embryonic lethality due to cardiac failure (no contraction) by 6&#226;&#8364;&#8220;7 dpf. <br />  <br />                                           Metabolic regulation is inextricably linked with cardiac function. This metabolism&#226;&#8364;&#8220;function <br />                                           relationship is relevant to diseases that lead to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (Huss and <br />                                           Kelly, 2005). NADH is essential to generate ATP (Brandes and Bers, 1996) and the amount <br />                                           of ATP has been shown to be decreased in failing hearts because of decreased energy reserve <br />                                           (Nascimben et al., 2004). To determine whether the knockdown of zlrrc10 caused any <br />                                           perturbations in energy metabolism, fluorescence intensity images of the heart at 780 nm were <br />                                           collected in live zebrafish embryos using multiphoton microscopy, which reflects the amount <br />                                           of NADH (Fig. 4F). We have shown previously that the signal at 780 nm multiphoton excitation <br />                                           is dominated by the NADH signal (Skala et al., 2007). Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           in the morphant heart was reduced by 45% as compared to control (NIH Image J analysis), <br />                                           suggesting that energy reserve is likely reduced in the morphant heart (Fig. 4G). <br />  <br />                                           These results so far demonstrate that reduced expression of Lrrc10 caused the decreased cardiac <br />                                           output during early development, in part due to malformation of the heart. These changes in <br />                                           the functional cardiac profile do not seem to correlate to adult cardiac hypertrophy in human <br />                                           or mice where there are no changes in ejection fraction. It should be noted that there was a <br />                                           marked increase in EDV in normal embryos from 4 to 5 dpf, which reflects the normal <br />                                           functional changes during development. The reduced EDV in the zlrrc10 morphant may be <br />                                           attributed to an inability to dilate after the contraction or to the defective cardiac chamber <br />                                           growth resulting in a small ventricle. Therefore, we investigated whether the number of <br />                                           cardiomyocytes is reduced in the morphant heart. <br />  <br />                               Myocardial cell number is reduced in the zlrrc10 morphants <br />                                           Since the ventricle of the zlrrc10 morphants seemed smaller than control, the atrium showed <br />                                           a string-like shape at 3&#226;&#8364;&#8220;4 dpf (Figs. 2 and 3), and EDV was reduced especially at 5 dpf (Fig. <br />                                           4), we investigated whether chamber growth was defective in these morphants. We used a <br />                                           transgenic zebrafish line (cmlc2:: dsRed2-nuc) where cardiomyocytes are marked by the <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           nuclear RFP to determine the effect of reduced Lrrc10 expression on the number of <br />                                           cardiomyocytes in the heart. MO1 or CMO was injected into cmlc2::dsRed2-nuc eggs after <br />                                           fertilization to count cardiomyocytes (Figs. 5A and B). In the normal developing heart, the <br />                                           number of cardiomyocytes per heart was significantly increased from 3 to 4 dpf, indicating <br />                                           normal developmental growth. In contrast, the total number of cardiomyocytes in the zlrrc10 <br />                                           morphant heart was not significantly increased. Instead, a 14.5% or 25.4% decrease in the total <br />                                           cardiomyocyte number was observed in the morphants at 3 or 4 dpf, respectively. These results <br />                                           suggest that cell proliferation is defective in the heart of the zlrrc10 morphant. However, it is <br />                                           not clear whether the reduced cell number results from very early defects in cells in the <br />                                           precardiac region (for example, reduced number of cardiac precursor cells) or from <br />                                           proliferation defects during cardiac development between 2 and 4 dpf.

Next, to determine the underlying causes of these cardiac defects, we <br />                                           investigated alterations in gene expression of several important cardiac marker genes in the <br />                                           heart of morphants (Fig. 6). Atrial natriuretic factor (anf) gene expression in the zlrrc10 <br />                                           morphants was assessed because of its established responsiveness to various physiological and <br />                                           pathological stimuli including those causing hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy in <br />                                           mammals (Rockman et al., 1994b). As in other species, the zebrafish anf gene is expressed in <br />                                           both the ventricle and atrium before becoming restricted to the atrium (Berdougo et al., <br />                                           2003). ANF is known as a hallmark for cardiac hypertrophy because ANF expression is <br />                                           switched off in the normal adult heart, whereas it is re-expressed in hypertrophic and failing <br />                                           hearts. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of anf showed a marked increase in anf expression <br />                                           in both the ventricle and atrium of 2 day old morphants (Fig. 6A, b and d) as compared to <br />                                           control (Fig. 6A, a and c). These results suggest dysfunction of the heart in the zlrrc10 <br />                                           morphants as early as 2 dpf, when the heart has just finished an initial looping process. It is <br />                                           interesting that cardiac morphology of this particular zlrrc10 morphant seems normal at this <br />                                           stage of development. Therefore, these results suggest that induction of anf expression is very <br />                                           sensitive to altered cardiac function. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           We also examined expression of the gene encoding sarcomere proteins such as cmlc2 and <br />                                           myosin heavy chain (MHC) because genes encoding sarcomere components are often altered <br />                                           in response to pathologic conditions (Antos et al., 2002). cmlc2 has been shown to be expressed <br />                                           in embryonic heart and to have a critical role in thick-myofilament assembly and contractility <br />                                           in the zebrafish embryonic heart (Rottbauer et al., 2006; Yelon et al., 1999). In the morphant <br />                                           at 2 dpf, expression of cmlc2 was decreased in the ventricle and atrium as compared to control <br />                                           (in Fig. 6, compare e and g to f and h), which may be partly responsible for abnormal <br />                                           contractility and reduced cardiac output. Since there was only a 14.5% reduction in the <br />                                           cardiomyocyte number in the morphant at 3 dpf (see Fig. 5) and both the morphants and control <br />                                           have about two layers of myocytes in the ventricular wall (see Fig. 3), it is unlikely that the <br />                                           decreased expression of cmlc2 is entirely due to the reduced number of cardiomyocytes. <br />                                           Looping defects and the small ventricle were obvious in this morphant (Fig. 6A, f and h), which <br />                                           are consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3. To obtain quantitative expression data, semi- <br />                                           quantitative RT-PCR was performed (Fig. 6B). Expression of anf was up-regulated about 73%, <br />                                           but cmlc2 was down-regulated about 50% as compared to control (NIH Image J analysis), <br />                                           which correlates well with the in situ hybridization results. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           Immunostaining of zebrafish embryos with MF20 antibody that recognizes sarcomere myosin <br />                                           heavy chain showed no detectable changes in the expression level between the zlrrc10 <br />                                           morphants and control (compare Fig. 6A, k and l). These data so far indicate that the zlrrc10 <br />                                           morphants exhibit increased expression of anf, a hallmark for cardiac hypertrophy and failure, <br />                                           but decreased expression of cmlc2. <br />  <br />                               Discussion <br />                               Lrrc10 is essential for early cardiac development <br />                                           To advance our understanding of early cardiac development, we identified the cardiac-specific <br />                                           gene zlrrc10 and characterized its developmental roles in zebrafish in this study.

The cardiac insufficiency is likely a cause for embryos dying at 6&#226;&#8364;&#8220;7 day post <br />                                          fertilization when embryos require active transportation of nutrients for survival and growth. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                          The zebrafish has become an attractive model for molecular biologists and geneticists, with <br />                                          most studies focused on the early embryonic stages (Alexander and Stainier, 1999; Chen et al., <br />                                          1996; Weinstein and Fishman, 1996). Recently, information related to the morphology and <br />                                          function of the developing as well as mature zebrafish heart has been reported (Grimes et al., <br />                                          2006; Hu et al., 2000; Hu et al., 2001), which provides a framework for structure&#226;&#8364;&#8220;function <br />                                          analyses of the zebrafish cardiovascular system. The most striking phenotype observed in the <br />                                          zlrrc10 morphants is a cardiac looping failure accompanied by a large pericardial edema at 2 <br />                                          dpf, suggesting cardiac insufficiency at a very early developmental stage. The pericardial <br />                                          edema gets progressively larger, which indicates that cardiac insufficiency worsens as the <br />                                          zlrrc10 morphants develop. <br />  <br />                                          It is often not clear whether morphogenic defects, a failure in the looping process in this case, <br />                                          cause cardiac malfunctions or vice versa since both looping defects and pericardiac edema <br />                                          were simultaneously observed at the very early developmental stage. It has been reported that <br />                                          proper cardiac contractility is necessary for normal cardiac morphogenesis. Hemodynamic <br />                                          parameters are known to be a determinant of myocardial growth, structure, and function in <br />                                          both the developing (Berdougo et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2003; Rottbauer et al., 2006) and <br />                                          adult heart and may be important in the etiology of heart failure (Hutchins et al., 1978; Rockman <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                          et al., 1994a). It has been postulated that normal flow and hemodynamics are also crucial <br />                                          determinants of normal cardiac morphogenesis and may play a causative role in congenital <br />                                          heart disease (Sedmera et al., 1998). In this regard, it is interesting that MO2, which is a much <br />                                          less efficient morpholino than MO1 in inhibiting translation of zlrrc10, caused looping defects <br />                                          that persisted during development. However, the pericardial edema began to be improved at <br />                                          4&#226;&#8364;&#8220;5 dpf, suggesting recovery of cardiac function. These results indicate that cardiac <br />                                          malfunctions in zlrrc10 morphants were not entirely due to morphogenic defects, but suggest <br />                                          an independent role of Lrrc10 in morphogenesis from cardiac function. <br />  <br />                               Underlying mechanisms of cardiac defects <br />                                          Although we clearly demonstrated in this study that Lrrc10 is essential for early cardiac <br />                                          development and function, the molecular function of Lrrc10 remains to be elucidated. Due to <br />                                          lack of a functional domain in Lrrc10, it is difficult to hypothesize its exact molecular function <br />                                          from its deduced amino acid sequence. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif is believed to <br />                                          function as a protein interaction domain. The zLrrc10 protein contains seven LRRs without <br />                                          any other functional domains as in mouse and human LRRC10. Therefore, it is plausible that <br />                                          LRRC10 regulates cellular processes by interacting with other factors that are critical for <br />                                          cardiac development and function. LRRC10 has been reported to be localized in the nucleus <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                          of immature cardiomyocytes, but in the cytoplasm of adult cardiomyocytes in mice (Adameyko <br />                                          et al., 2005). However, nuclear localization of LRRC10 in heart sections has been reported in <br />                                          adult mice (Nakane et al., 2004). This controversial but dynamic subcellular localization of <br />                                          LRRC10 suggests that it has critical and possibly changing roles as the heart matures. <br />                                          Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the molecular function of LRRC10 as a nuclear <br />                                          or cytoplasmic factor. In this regard, the present study provides a solid foundation to further <br />                                          study the molecular function of LRRC10. <br />  <br />                                          In an effort to determine what cellular changes occurred in the zlrrc10 morphants, we have <br />                                          performed candidate gene approaches (Fig. 6), which yielded two genes that are deregulated <br />                                          in the zlrrc10 morphants. anf expression was markedly increased both in the ventricle and <br />                                          atrium of the zlrrc10 morphant heart as compared to the control heart at 2 dpf. The ANF gene <br />                                          is expressed very early in embryonic development, at the stage when cells are committed to <br />  <br />  <br />                                                Dev Biol.

Throughout embryonic and fetal development, ANF expression <br />                                         characterizes both atrial and ventricular cells. However, ANF is switched off in the normal <br />                                         adult heart, but is re-expressed in hypertrophic and failing hearts. Therefore, ANF is a <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         biomarker for cardiac hypertrophy. Likewise, the zebrafish anf gene is expressed in both the <br />                                         ventricle and atrium before becoming restricted to the atrium (Berdougo et al., 2003). Although <br />                                         cardiac hypertrophic responses have not been studied in the zebrafish embryonic heart, it is <br />                                         plausible that the zlrrc10 morphants are undergoing similar responses to cardiac hypertrophy/ <br />                                         failure or cardiomyopathy as in the adult heart.

and compact ventricle (Berdougo et al., 2003). <br />  <br />                                         Our candidate gene analyses indicate that cmlc2 in the heart is decreased in the zlrrc10 <br />                                         morphants as compared to the control heart. cmlc2 in zebrafish is expressed throughout the <br />                                         heart, unlike the chamber-specific pattern reported for regulatory MLCs in mouse and human. <br />                                         cmlc2 appears to be the only regulatory mlc gene expressed in the heart of the zebrafish <br />                                         (Rottbauer et al., 2006). It is well known that mutations in the cardiac regulatory myosin light <br />                                         chain-2 (cmlc2) gene cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Recently, a mutation in zebrafish, <br />                                         tell tale heart (tel), which selectively perturbs contractility of the embryonic heart and gives <br />                                         rise to a defective morphology resembling looping defects, was identified as a mutation in the <br />                                         zebrafish cmlc2 gene (Rottbauer et al., 2006). Ultrastructural analysis of tel cardiomyocytes <br />                                         reveals complete absence of organized myofilaments, demonstrating in vivo that Cmlc2 is <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         required for thick filament stabilization and contractility in the vertebrate heart. Therefore, it <br />                                         is possible that the reduced cmlc2 expression in the zlrrc10 morphants is in part responsible <br />                                         for reduced cardiac output leading to cardiac insufficiency. <br />  <br />                                         It is interesting that the zlrrc10 morphants contain a reduced number of cardiomyocytes at 3 <br />                                         and 4 dpf as compared to the control heart. In the normal heart, the number of cardiomyocytes <br />                                         significantly increases from 3 to 4 dpf whereas it does not occur in the morphants. This reduced <br />                                         cardiomyocyte number in the zlrrc10 morphants may in part lead to the decreased EDV (Figs. <br />                                         4 and 5), which in turn leads to cardiac insufficiency. It remains to be elucidated whether the <br />                                         decreased cardiomyocyte number in the morphants is primary or secondary to other cellular <br />                                         defects. Our current data cannot distinguish whether there are cardiomyocyte proliferation <br />                                         defects 3&#226;&#8364;&#8220;4 dpf in the zlrrc10 morphant heart or this decrease in cardiomyocyte number is a <br />                                         result of a reduction in the number of cardiac precursor cells in early embryos. Although we <br />                                         have not detected any significant increases in apoptosis in the morphants (data not shown, <br />                                         2007), there is a possibility that aberrant apoptosis may have caused the reduction in cell <br />                                         number. Apoptosis is a normal process of developing organs, which is also required for normal <br />                                         outflow tract development in chicken (Schaefer et al., 2004). The developing heart does not <br />                                         show a high number of apoptotic cells in the myocardium (data not shown, 2007), but apoptotic <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         cells are detected in certain regions such as the apex of the heart, endocardial cushion area, and <br />                                         outflow tract during chicken or mouse development (Schaefer et al., 2004;Wikenheiser et al., <br />                                         2006). <br />  <br />                                         It is intriguing that total NADH amount in the morphant heart was decreased in live zebrafish <br />                                         embryos (Fig. 4F). There is a possibility that Lrrc10 directly regulates the metabolic pathways <br />                                         that produce NADH. It has been demonstrated that derangements in energy metabolism cause <br />                                         heart failure (Huss and Kelly, 2005). Alternatively, energy metabolism may have been altered <br />                                         as a consequence of cardiac malfunction/failure caused by Lrrc10 knockdown. NADH provides <br />                                         the electron transport chain with electrons necessary to build the proton motive force, ultimately <br />                                         regenerating ATP from ADP and Pi (Brandes and Bers, 1996). The amount of ATP has been <br />                                         reported to be decreased in failing hearts because of decreased energy reserve (Nascimben et <br />                                         al., 2004). In fact, heart failure of any cause is associated with a decline in the activity of the <br />                                         mitochondrial pathway (Huss and Kelly, 2005). We have recently demonstrated that LRRC10 <br />  <br />  <br />                                               Dev Biol.

Therefore, zLrrc10 may not directly regulate the mitochondrial structure/ <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           function to regulate ATP production or be involved in sarcomeric organization. It is likely that <br />                                           Lrrc10 knockdown directly or indirectly caused reduced NADH amount and, therefore energy <br />                                           reserve in the form of ATP. The fluorescence intensity is mostly from NADH, but may include <br />                                           FAD (Bird et al., 2004;Bird et al., 2005), which is also a source of ATP generation. Although <br />                                           FAD can be detected with NADH in our measurement, the NADH amount produced by the <br />                                           glucose metabolism is five times higher than FAD that is mainly produced by fatty acid <br />                                           metabolism (Berg et al., 2002). Moreover, glucose is a preferred energy source in the embryonic <br />                                           heart (Huss and Kelly, 2005;Scheuer, 2004). In addition, spectral characterization of NADH <br />                                           and FAD at 780 nm using a spectrofluorometer (Fluorolog, Horiba) indicates that the primary <br />                                           signal is NADH (personal communication with Long Yan). <br />  <br />                                           Altogether we have discovered that Lrrc10 is essential for normal cardiac development and <br />                                           cardiac function in the zebrafish embryo. Because early cardiac morphogenic defects <br />                                           accompanied by a pericardial edema were identified in the zlrrc10 morphants, we now know <br />                                           that a previously uncharacterized factor in zebrafish plays critical roles in heart development <br />                                           and function and could potentially be involved in human congenital heart defects and/or certain <br />                                           types of adult heart disease. Therefore, this study will provide the critical insights into the <br />                                           complex mechanisms of normal cardiac development, which will lead us to determine the <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           molecular basis of congenital heart defects, and adult cardiac disease. <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />                                                Dev Biol.
