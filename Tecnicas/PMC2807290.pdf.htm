Stage III, PID with <br /> tubo-ovarian mass, was drained by posterior colpotomy when indicated or treated with triple <br /> antibiotics when high abdominal masses were present. Stage IV, ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess, was <br /> always surgically treated. Mortality was almost limited to patients with stage IV PID, 15% (3/20) of <br /> whom died. Morbidity included the need for laparotomy (in 1.6% (6/368) of stage II, 59.3% (45/76) <br /> of stage III, and 100% of 20 stage IV patients) and draining pus (in 6-6% (5/76) of stage III cases and <br /> 50% (10/20) of stage IV patients). This study also shows that unspecialised hospital staff are able to <br /> use Monif&apos;s staging correctly, and that acceptable results can be obtained with the limited resources <br /> that are available in most developing countries. <br />  <br />  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is one of the most            obtained, and to present the main complications <br /> important consequences of sexually transmitted dis-              observed in a Zimbabwean community during a 15 <br /> ease (STD) and represents the gynaecological condi-              month period. <br /> tion afflicting African women most commonly.&apos; In <br /> developing countries this condition constitutes a                Patients and methods <br /> major public health challenge: high mortality, pro- <br /> longed hospital stays for many patients, and multiple              I studied all women who were seen with a diagnosis of <br /> operations for late sequellae such as infertility, tubal           PID at this hospital <span id='am-1' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> 1 January 1985 to 31 March <br /> pregnancy, and chronic lower abdominal pain.                       1986.
