A genetic screen for mutations that are lethal in combination with <br />              cdc7-1 led <span id='am-3' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> the isolation of seven lsd (lethal with seven defect) complementation groups. The lsd7 <br />              complementation group contained two temperature-sensitive dbf4 alleles. The lsd1 complementation group <br />              contained a new allele of RAD53, which was designated rad53-31. RAD53 encodes an essential protein <br />              kinase that is required for the activation of DNA damage and DNA replication checkpoint pathways, and <br />              that is implicated as a positive regulator of S phase. Unlike other RAD53 alleles, we demonstrate that the <br />              rad53-31 allele retains an intact checkpoint function. Thus, the checkpoint function and the DNA replica- <br />              tion function of RAD53 can be functionally separated. The activation of DNA replication through RAD53 <br />              most likely occurs through DBF4. Two-hybrid analysis indicates that the Rad53p protein binds to Dbf4p. <br />              Furthermore, the steady-state level of DBF4 message and Dbf4p protein is reduced in several rad53 mutant <br />              strains, indicating that RAD53 positively regulates DBF4. These results suggest that two different functions <br />              of the cell cycle, initiation of DNA replication and the checkpoint function, can be coordinately regulated <br />              through the common intermediate RAD53. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> T     HE initiation of DNA replication is a strictly regu- <br />       lated process that is coupled tightly to cell cycle <br /> progression and results in the accurate duplication of <br />                                                                            Isolation of mutants defective in cell cycle progression <br />                                                                          led to the identification of CDC7, a gene encoding a <br />                                                                          nuclear serine/threonine kinase that is essential for the <br /> the genetic material. Orderly cell cycle events ensure                   initiation of S phase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hart- <br /> that the initiation of DNA replication occurs once, and                  well 1973; Bahman et al. 1988; Hollingsworth and <br /> only once, per cell cycle.

These surveillance mechanisms, termed check-                    throughout S phase for origin firing, but not for elon- <br /> points, ensure that the integrity of the genome is intact                gation (Bousset and Diffley 1998; Donaldson et al. <br /> before proceeding through crucial cellular events (for                   1998).

have been isolated in different <br /> screens for mutations with a checkpoint defect (Zheng <br /> et al. 1993; Allen et al. 1994; Weinert et al. 1994). Cells <br /> harboring a rad53-11 (5mec2-1) mutation, for example, <br /> exhibit rapid loss of viability in the presence of DNA- <br /> damaging agents, such as UV light, because they lack <br /> the ability to inhibit cell cycle progression (Zheng et al. <br /> 1993; Allen et al. 1994; Weinert et al. 1994). Likewise, <br /> rad53-11 mutants die rapidly in the presence of hydroxy- <br /> urea, a drug that normally stalls replication forks by <br /> limiting nucleotide availability through inhibition of <br /> ribonucleotide reductase (Allen et al. 1994; Weinert <br /> et al. 1994). We therefore tested rad53-31 for a check- <br /> point defect. As expected, the rad53-11 strain showed a <br /> marked decline in viability in response to increasing <br /> UV doses (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, the rad53-31 strain <br /> exhibited a sensitivity to UV damage comparable to that <br /> of the wild-type strain control (Figure 1A). <br />    For analysis of the S phase checkpoint, survival of <br /> wild-type, rad53-11, and rad53-31 strains in the presence <br /> of 200 mm hydroxyurea was examined. Again, as ex-                  Figure 1.&#226;&#8364;&#8221;Absence of checkpoint deficiency in the rad53- <br /> pected, the rad53-11 strain demonstrated a marked de-           31 strain.

We conclude that rad53-31 is still proficient in          dilution (200&#226;&#8364;&#8220;500 cfu/plate), irradiated with the indicated <br /> checkpoint function.                                            doses of UV light, and percent survival was determined relative <br />    Genetic interactions among RAD53 alleles and several         to unirradiated controls.

Therefore,           <br /> it follows that RAD53 must regulate some qualitative         <br /> difference in Dbf4p protein.                                 <br />    We would hypothesize that perhaps Rad53p binds to           <br /> and modifies Dbf4p protein. The qualitative difference         <br /> in Dbf4p activity would be partly responsible for the        <br /> activation of the DNA replication initiation program.       <br /> In addition, the activation of DBF4 transcription and/          <br /> or degradation of DBF4 message through RAD53 could <br /> be through a positive feedback loop based on the level <br /> of activity of the Dbf4p protein. This would explain                               <br /> reasonably why the DBF4 message and protein levels in <br />                                                                <br /> rad53-31 mutants are not affected severely. At the same              <br /> time, in rad53D::hisG mutants, Rad53p is unavailable to       <br /> modify Dbf4p, and as a consequence, DBF4 message           <br /> and Dbf4p protein rapidly disappear.                       <br />    With the dramatic reduction of Dbf4p protein, the                 <br /> cells are still viable in the rad53D::hisG strain. Perhaps       <br /> the essential role of RAD53 is to regulate the expression      <br /> of RNR1 because high-copy expression of RNR1 can                  <br /> bypass the rad53D::hisG defect. At the same time, RAD53       <br /> may also regulate DBF4 levels to ensure rapid S phase           <br /> entry through this positive feedback loop.
