However, development in technologies used <br />                                 to identify cellular targets of potent antibacterial inhibitors has lagged behind. Here we describe a <br />                                 novel strategy of target identification for antibacterial inhibitors using an array of Escherichia coli <br />                                 clones each over-expressing one essential protein. In a proof-of-concept study, eight essential <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                 genes were cloned into pLex5BA vector under the control of an inducible promoter. Over- <br />                                 expression of target proteins was confirmed. For two clones, one over-expressing FabI and the <br />                                 other over-expressing MurA enzymes, the host cells became 17-fold and 139-fold more resistant <br />                                 to the specific inhibitors triclosan and phosphomycin, respectively, while the susceptibility of <br />                                 other clones towards these inhibitors remained unchanged after induction of gene expression. <br />                                 Target identification via target protein over-expression was demonstrated using both mixed clone <br />                                 and individual clone assay formats. <br />  <br />  <br />                            Keywords <br />                                 Escherichia coli; Essential genes; Drug targets; Antibacterial compounds; Over-expression; <br />                                 Triclosan; Phosphomycin <br />  <br />  <br />                            Introduction <br />                                              Over the past 20 years, emergence and dissemination of bacterial resistance to existing <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                              antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate [1-3]. Especially troublesome is the emergence <br />                                              of diverse pathogens that became multi-drug resistant [4-7], posing a serious threat to global <br />                                              public health. During this same period, few antibiotics of New Chemical Entities (NCEs) <br />                                              have emerged [8], reflecting both the challenges of identifying NCEs and a reduced <br />                                              commitment of antibiotic drug discovery by pharmaceutical companies. One factor <br />                                              contributing to the dismal productivity in this therapeutic area has been the lack of a <br />                                              comprehensive knowledge of bacterial essential genes. Since the first sequencing of a <br />                                              complete microbial genome, Mycoplasma genitalium [9], a decade ago, more than 350 <br />                                              bacterial genomes have been completely sequenced, including Escherichia coli [10], <br />                                              Bacillus subtilis [11] and many important human pathogens. The rapid advances in <br />                                              microbial genomics could potentially lead to renewed efforts and technological <br />  <br />  <br />                            *Corresponding author.

The recognition of the utilities of untapped potential antibiotic <br />                                            targets has fostered various innovative approaches for bacterial essential gene identification, <br />                                            facilitating the development of a new discipline&#226;&#8364;&#8221;bacterial functional genomics. <br />                                            Comparative genomics has been combined with conditional expression to identify essential <br />                                            genes in E. coli [14,15]. Promoter replacement techniques have been developed to assess the <br />                                            essentiality of Staphylococcus aureus genes [16,17]. Massive transposon mutagenesis has <br />                                            been applied to identify essential genes on genome-scale in M. genitalium [18], <br />                                            Haemophilus influenzae [19,20], and E. coli [21]. Gene disruption methodologies have been <br />                                            employed to systematically identify essential genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae [22] and <br />                                            B. subtilis [23]. Finally, regulated antisense expression [24,25] has been utilized to identify a <br />                                            comprehensive set of essential genes in S. aureus. Conjoint analysis of several <br />                                            computational models and experimental strategies has led to the proposition that, <span id='am-2' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> a <br />                                            standpoint of cellular processes necessary to maintain cellular life, a minimal bacterial <br />                                            essential set contains 206 genes [13]. Bacterial essential genes thus far identified have been <br />                                            increasingly used in either cell-based or biochemical drug screens [26-28]. <br />  <br />                                            Historically, the most productive paradigm for antibacterial lead discovery involved a <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            straightforward initial screen for the inhibition of bacterial growth. This was followed by <br />                                            laborious experimental attempts to identify drug targets and establish mechanisms of action <br />                                            for those discovered antibacterial compounds. Once and if the target of the hit compound <br />                                            was identified, antibacterial potency and selectivity were then optimized through the <br />                                            synthesis and testing of structural analogs of the initial hit compound. With increased <br />                                            exploitation of chemical space (in which distance between points approximates compound <br />                                            similarity), it is still simple, fast and straightforward to identify inhibitors of bacterial <br />                                            growth. What remains difficult is to experimentally link the inhibitor to the cellular target. <br />                                            There is therefore a need for development of fast and comprehensive assay systems to <br />                                            identify cellular targets of potent antibacterial inhibitors. Li and colleagues [29] recently <br />                                            reported a strategy of identifying targets of antibacterial inhibitors via suppression of <br />                                            inhibition by multicopy plasmid clones of an E. coli random genomic library. While this <br />                                            approach does not require large scale cloning efforts, it would be difficult to judge the <br />                                            comprehensiveness of the essential gene coverage in the clones of the genomic library <br />                                            without detailed validation experiments. In this report, we describe a novel strategy to <br />                                            identify the target of an inhibitor via a comprehensive collection (array) of E. coli clones <br />                                            each engineered to over-express one essential protein. This strategy is based on the concept <br />                                            that elevated levels of the drug target protein confer resistance because higher <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            concentrations of a specific inhibitor are required to bind to the excess target in order to <br />                                            inhibit bacterial growth [30]. In this proof-of-concept report, we confirmed elevated <br />                                            inhibitor-specific resistance of E. coli strains over-expressing specific essential targets and <br />                                            demonstrated identification of cellular targets for inhibitors using either a culture of mixed <br />                                            clones or parallel growth of individual clones each over-expressing one particular essential <br />                                            gene. If this strategy is applicable to a large number of essential genes in E. coli, it would <br />                                            become a very useful assay tool to identify cellular targets of inhibitors of unknown <br />                                            mechanisms of action. <br />  <br />                               Materials and Methods <br />                               Bacterial strains, plasmid and materials <br />                                            Purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 (Genotype: F- lambda- <br />                                            ilvG- rfb-50 rph-1) was used as the source of chromosomal DNA with known genomic <br />  <br />  <br />                                        Biochem Biophys Res Commun.

Essential genes were selected from <br />                                            the PEC (Profiling of E. coli Chromosome) database. PCR primers were designed to include <br />                                            the complete open reading frame (ORF) of each gene and its putative Shine-Delgarno <br />                                            sequence in the amplified product. Appropriate restriction endonuclease recognition sites <br />                                            were designed into PCR primers to facilitate the cloning process. Genes were directionally <br />                                            cloned downstream of an IPTG-inducible promoter present on the plasmid [31]. <br />                                            Recombinant plasmid clones were initially validated via restriction digest and agarose gel <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            electrophoresis.

Briefly, an E. coli <br />                                            strain harboring a plasmid with an inserted essential gene was streaked on an LB agar plate <br />                                            with 100 &#206;&#188;g/ml of ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 &#194;&#176;C.

Results indicated that for FabI, MurA and <br />                                            TrpS clones, there was significant over-expression of essential proteins at 4 h after induction <br />                                            and that continued induction beyond 4 h did not appear to further increase the protein <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            expression. Specifically, there were protein bands of similar intensity present in both 4 hr <br />                                            and overnight post-induction samples of a MurA clone that match the calculated molecular <br />                                            weight (44.8 kD) of MurA protein (Fig. 2). Similarly, cells of a TrpS clone produced an <br />                                            obviously over-expressed polypeptide band that corresponds to TrpS enzyme&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s calculated <br />                                            molecular weight (37.4kD) (Fig. 2). In contrast, over-expression of a FabI clone resulted in a <br />                                            protein band corresponding to a molecular weight of around 33 kDalton (Fig. 2), which is <br />                                            inconsistent with its calculated molecular weight of 28 kD. This type of discrepancies <br />                                            between calculated molecular weight of a polypeptide and electrophoretic outcome is not <br />                                            unusual. Interestingly, Bergler and coworkers over-expressed the same protein (FabI, used <br />                                            to be called EnvM) from E. coli and had obtained a similar result [33]. This led us to believe <br />                                            that the observed over-exppressed protein from FabI clone belonged to FabI enzyme. Of <br />                                            eight essential gene clones tested, all except PrfB clone demonstrated detectable over- <br />                                            expression by protein gel electrophoresis of cell-free extracts (data not shown). <br />  <br />                               Effects of induction on cell growth <br />                                            To determine whether or not the IPTG inducer of the over-expression of these essential <br />                                            proteins caused adverse effects on growth of these clones (since robust growth from each <br />                                            clone was critical for target identification assays), individual clones were grown in the <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            presence of a series of IPTG concentrations between 0.01 mM to 10 mM. Our results <br />                                            indicated that inducer concentrations as high as 10 mM (ten times as high as used in our <br />                                            experiments) did not cause significant growth defects on TrpS, RplJ, FabI and MurA clones <br />                                            (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained with FabD, RpsL, PrfB, MurG and vector clones (data <br />                                            not shown) <br />  <br />                               Drug dose response and resistance testing <br />                                            To confirm the concept that target over-expression increases resistance to specific inhibitors, <br />                                            a FabI clone was grown in various concentrations of triclosan (the specific inhibitor of the <br />                                            FabI enzyme) in the LB medium with ampicillin in the presence and absence of 1 mM <br />                                            IPTG. Triclosan dose response curves for the FabI clone exhibited a significant shift in the <br />                                            presence of the inducer as compared to that in the absence of an inducer (Fig. 4). The IC50 <br />                                            values increased from 584 ng/ml to 9,927 ng/ml, a 17-fold increase in resistance, when over- <br />                                            expression of FabI was induced. In contrast, as expected since the vector contains no insert, <br />                                            the IC50 values for the vector clone did not change at all (Fig. 4). When a MurA clone was <br />                                            grown in various concentrations of phosphomycin, the specific inhibitor of the MurA <br />                                            enzyme, the increase in resistance was even more dramatic (a 139-fold change in IC50 <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            values as shown in Fig. 5). Interestingly, the elevated resistance conferred by induction of <br />                                            the target expression did not require the presence of ampicillin in the medium (Fig. 6). <br />                                            Without ampicillin in the LB medium, cells of MurA clone grew fairly well in the presence <br />                                            of 8 &#206;&#188;g/ml of phosphomycin under the condition of induction (Fig. 6). In the absence of <br />                                            IPTG, cells failed to grow in 8 &#206;&#188;g/ml of phosphomycin.

The ratio <br />                                            of IC50 induced vs IC50 non-induced was used as a measure of changes in a clone&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s <br />                                            susceptibility toward a particular inhibitor. Results indicated that elevated resistance to <br />                                            triclosan was observed only in the FabI clone, but not in any of the other seven over- <br />                                            expression clones (Fig. 7).

When eight over-expressing clones <br />                                            were mixed and subjected to treatment by inhibitory (to the parental strain) concentrations of <br />                                            triclosan and phosphomycin, respectively, cell growth was observed in the presence of 1 <br />                                            mM IPTG in both treatments over a range of inhibitor concentrations (data not shown). We <br />                                            suspected that the cell growth observed was due to the enhanced resistance of the one clone <br />                                            that was over-expressing a specific target protein. To test this, cultures with growth from the <br />                                            wells containing 2 &#206;&#188;g/ml of phosphomycin and 8 &#206;&#188;g/ml of triclosan were serially diluted and <br />                                            plated out on LB agar plates with 100 &#206;&#188;g/ml of ampicillin. Isolated colonies from each <br />                                            inhibitor treatment were grown and plasmids were isolated to perform restriction digest <br />                                            analysis. Restriction analysis results indicated that 100% of the colonies from phosphomycin <br />                                            treatment contained murA gene inserts and 100% of the colonies from triclosan treatment <br />                                            contained fabI gene inserts (Fig. 8a and 8b). Subsequent plasmid DNA sequencing further <br />                                            confirmed that the growth was indeed the result of the clones over-producing the specific <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            target proteins to which the specific inhibitors binds (data not shown). <br />  <br />                               Target identification using individual clone assay <br />                                            To test whether or not treatment by an inhibitor of individually grown over-expression <br />                                            clones also could identify the target of the inhibitor, eight over-expression clones were <br />                                            individually grown in the presence or absence of inhibitors triclosan (4 &#206;&#188;g/ml) and <br />                                            phosphomycin (2 &#206;&#188;g/ml), with or without 1 mM IPTG (Fig. 9). As can be seen from Figure <br />                                            9, for those wells without inhibitors, cells grew normally with or without inducer as <br />                                            expected (used as inoculum control). Microplate wells G5 and G6, the only two wells <br />                                            containing the FabI clone with both triclosan and IPTG present, produced robust growth <br />                                            similar to the wells of the inoculum control (Fig. 9). For wells treated with phosphomycin, <br />                                            only two wells (F1 and F2) from the MurA clone row containing both phosphomycin and <br />                                            the inducer grew normally. <br />  <br />                               Discussion <br />                                            Recognition of the mechanism of antibiotic resistance due to drug target over-expression <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            was first reported decades ago [34]. This line of research has received little attention over <br />                                            the years, probably because the earlier examples were laboratory phenomena with no <br />                                            clinical relevance [34,35]. More recently, however, it has been reported that target over- <br />                                            expression probably accounts for acquired resistance to isoniazid and ethambutol in clinical <br />                                            isolates of mycobacteria [36,37]. In these studies, over-expression of targets through <br />                                            promoter mutations appeared to be responsible for resistance in drug resistant clinical <br />                                            isolates. In a laboratory setting, bacterial target proteins have been over-expressed either to <br />                                            study the function of the enzymes or to examine the interaction of inhibitors and target <br />                                            proteins. Over-expression of prolipoprotein signal peptidase (gene product of lsp) was <br />                                            shown to confer its host cells a high level of resistance to globomycin, an inhibitor of <br />                                            lipoprotein signal peptidase [38]. Turnowsky and colleagues [39] demonstrated that over- <br />                                            expression of EnvM (FabI) protein from the plasmid-borne gene conferred resistance to <br />                                            diazaborine, a specific inhibitor for FabI.

They isolated nine plasmids, all of which contain a <br />                                            functional fabB gene. Over-expression of FabB protein appeared to lead to increased <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            resistance to thiolactomycin in E. coli [40]. Apfel and colleagues [41] demonstrated that <br />                                            over-expression of peptide deformylase in a cell reduced its susceptibility to inhibitors <br />                                            specific for the essential target, peptide deformylase. <br />  <br />                                            Recently, there have been several reports of using target over-expression to confirm targets <br />                                            of drugs or inhibitors in a number of microorganisms. Over-expression of farnesyl <br />                                            diphosphate synthase (FDP synthase) in social amoeba Dictyostelium resulted in resistance <br />                                            to aminobisphosphate inhibitors [42]. Butcher and coworkers [43] constructed a pool of <br />                                            Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains each over-expressing a different protein. These strains <br />                                            were grown in the presence of rapamycin and the growth was monitored by microarray. <br />                                            Candidate target proteins of rapamycin were identified [43]. While the approaches by these <br />                                            groups [42,43] are valuable and robust, they are limited only for use in identification of <br />                                            targets of antifungal compounds. In a recent report using a bacterial system (E. coli), <br />                                            multicopy suppressors were identified for antibacterial compounds as a method of <br />                                            determining the targets of the inhibitors and the mechanisms of resistance [29]. In this study <br />                                            [29], an E. coli random genomic library was screened for clones which could suppress <br />                                            antibacterial activities of inhibitors to a hyperpermeable strain of E. coli. As a result, the <br />                                            majority of suppressors were found to encode the multidrug efflux pump AcrB and a target <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            of two lead compounds was identified as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), encoded by the <br />                                            folA gene [29]. This approach of screening genomic libraries for suppressor clones is a <br />                                            significant method of identifying targets of antibacterial inhibitors. However, due to the <br />                                            random nature of genomic libraries and of cloned inserts, it is difficult to determine if an <br />                                            essential gene is structurally intact or functionally expressed in a plasmid clone without <br />                                            extensive validation experiments. <br />  <br />                                            Here we report on a first deliberate effort to clone individual essential genes from E. coli for <br />                                            the sole purpose of constructing an array of E. coli over-expression clones to identify <br />                                            cellular targets of potent antibacterial inhibitors generated from high throughput screening <br />                                            campaigns. As a proof-of-concept, we cloned eight essential genes in E. coli, observed <br />                                            essential protein over-expression in majority of the clones (seven out of eight) and <br />                                            confirmed elevated resistance of clones to their specific antibacterial inhibitors. We <br />                                            demonstrated proof of concept in identification of targets of two known inhibitors. Our <br />                                            results suggest that the approach is very likely a generic one and can provide a viable tool <br />                                            for identification of cellular targets of potent inhibitors and for studies of drug-target <br />                                            interactions. Additionally, with each essential gene clone sequence validated and over- <br />                                            expression demonstrated, we have the choices of two complimentary and corroborating <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            assay formats for the identification of targets of potent inhibitors: the mixed clone method <br />                                            and the individual clone method. Both assay formats have their own advantages. The mixed <br />                                            clone method streamlines the number of growth vessels (microplate wells) used and may <br />                                            amplify even slightest fitness advantages of certain clones in a fitness test environment. The <br />                                            individually arrayed method is advantageous in that the well positions of every clone are <br />                                            known in advance, which enables a direct linkage of growth of a particular well to a target <br />                                            without genetic profiling of clones. In addition, both methods are amenable to robotic <br />                                            adaptation to a high throughput screening setting involving a large number of over- <br />                                            expressing clones and multiple potent antibacterial compounds. Once completed, this array <br />                                            of over-expression E. coli clones and the associated assays would facilitate discovery of <br />                                            novel antibiotics. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                        Biochem Biophys Res Commun.
