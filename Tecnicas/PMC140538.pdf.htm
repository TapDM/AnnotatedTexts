Again the <br /> at 4&#194;&#176;C.

However, cleavage of the 27SA2 and 27SA3 <br /> precursor species within ITS2 and the subsequent removal of <br /> the ITS2 spacer sequences from 7S pre-rRNA can still <br /> proceed. Figure 2C shows that upon LiCl treatment both the <br /> wild-type strain and the rrp5 deletion mutants indeed accu- <br /> mulate a product that hybridizes to probe 2, located between <br /> site A2 and A3, and that according to its mobility corresponds <br /> to the A2-E fragment. The same product is also recognized by <br /> probes 3 and 4 (Fig. 2D and E). Probe 6 (Fig. 2G) should not <br /> detect the A2-E fragment because it hybridizes only to RNA <br /> molecules that still contain at least a portion of ITS2. The band <br /> seen in Figure 2G, therefore, represents 7S pre-rRNA, which <br /> has almost the same size as the A2-E fragment. Probe 5 <br /> (Fig. 2F) detects both the A2-E fragment and 7S pre-rRNA. <br /> Furthermore, we can also detect the complementary D-A2 <br /> fragment of ITS1 in all three strains upon hybridization with <br /> probe 1 (Fig. 2H). Somewhat unexpectedly, we did not <br /> observe accumulation of the A3-E fragment upon hybridiza- <br /> tion with probes 4 or 5 (Fig. 2E and F). We surmise that this is <br /> due to the genetic makeup of our strains, because, as shown in <br /> Figure 2E (lane 10), the A3-E fragment could be visualized by <br /> probe 4 in another RRP5 wild-type strain, yRP840 (19), after <br /> treatment with LiCl for 2 h. Interestingly, however, probes 4 <br /> and 5 did detect a fragment in both the rrp5-D3 and rrp5-D4 <br /> strains that is absent from the wild-type cells (Fig. 2E and F, <br /> lanes 4&#194;&#177;9). The same fragment also hybridizes with probe 3, <br /> complementary to the region of ITS1 directly upstream from <br /> site A3 (Fig. 2D, lanes 4&#194;&#177;9), but not with either probe 2 <br /> (Fig. 2C) or probe 6 (Fig. 2G). The data indicate that in the <br /> rrp5-D3 and rrp5-D4 cells a novel processing event occurs <br /> within ITS1, either in addition to or instead of cleavage at A3. <br /> As judged from the electrophoretic mobility of the novel <br /> fragment its 5&#194;&#162;-end, which we have called A4, is located <br /> approximately midway between A2 and A3. <br />    In order to establish whether processing at A4 indeed <br /> replaces that at A3 and to map the location of the A4 site more <br />  <br />  <br /> Figure 2.

As <br /> shown in Figure 3A a stop corresponding to A3 is readily <br /> detectable in the wild-type strain upon LiCl treatment. In the <br /> two mutant strains, however, this stop has disappeared <br /> completely, indicating that cleavage at A3 is blocked <br /> completely. Instead, a new set of stops appears 34&#194;&#177;36 nt <br /> farther upstream. Together with the results of the northern <br /> hybridization shown in Figure 2 the data &#194;&#174;rmly establish the <br /> occurrence of an alternative-processing event within ITS1 in <br /> the rrp5 deletion mutants. Furthermore, our results show that <br /> there is no absolute link between cleavage at A3 and the <br /> formation of 5.8SS rRNA. Despite the absence of any <br /> detectable processing at site A3 in the rrp5-D4 mutant, in <br /> these cells ~40% of 5.8S rRNA still is the short form, which, <br /> therefore, should originate from the 27SA2 and/or 27SA4 <br /> intermediate. The existence of such a 27SA4 processing <br /> intermediate was corroborated by primer extension experi- <br /> ments using probes 6 and 7, located upstream and downstream <br /> of site C2 within ITS2, respectively (Fig. 2A). In both cases <br /> we observe a clear signal corresponding to site A4 in the <br /> samples isolated from LiCl-treated rrp5-D3 and rrp5-D4 <br /> mutant cells, while the signal corresponding to site A3 has <br /> disappeared. In particular the detection of site A4 with probe 7 <br /> is convincing evidence for the presence of a 27SA4 precursor. <br />    As shown in Figure 4 the A4 processing site maps to a <br /> region of the spacer that has been well conserved with respect <br /> to both primary and secondary structure in a wide variety of <br /> yeast species. The A4 site is located within a 5&#194;&#162;-UCUUUG-3&#194;&#162; <br /> consensus sequence that is part of a stem shared by all known <br /> yeast ITS1 regions. There is no obvious structural similarity <br /> between the A4 site and either the A2 or the A3 site. <br /> Synthetic lethality with rrp5-D4 identi&#194;&#174;es the REX4 gene <br /> In order to obtain more information on the manner in which <br /> Rrp5p functions in pre-rRNA processing we carried out a <br /> synthetic lethality screen with the rrp5-D4 mutation using the <br /> ade2/ade3 red-white colony sectoring assay, essentially as <br /> described previously (33) (see Materials and Methods for <br /> details).

We <br />                                                                    <br /> conclude that the change in ITS1 processing induced by the <br /> rrp5-D3 and rrp-D4 mutations requires intact Rex4p and that        <br /> in the absence of Rex4p the mutant processing complex              <br /> containing either mutant Rrp5p protein regains the ability to      <br /> direct RNaseMRP to the A3 site. The molecular basis for this      <br /> phenomenon remains a matter of speculation.

Another possibility is that Rex4p plays a <br /> role in the formation of an as yet unidenti&#194;&#174;ed trans-acting         <br />                                                                  <br /> factor that forms part of the processing complex containing        <br /> Rrp5p. In wild-type cells, however, the role of Rex4p is  <br /> critical.                                                         <br />    The lack of any detectable abnormalities in pre-rRNA         <br /> processing in the rrp5-D3/rex4&#194;&#177; and rrp5-D4/rex4&#194;&#177; double           <br />                                                                   <br /> mutants left us without an obvious explanation for the sl            <br /> phenotype of these mutants. Therefore, we considered the           <br /> possibility of a defect in ribosome assembly, which for            <br /> obvious reasons we studied in strains in which the wild-type        <br />                                                                      <br /> RRP5 gene is conditionally expressed. Sucrose gradient              <br /> analysis demonstrated that in fact the rrp5-D3 and rrp-D4            <br /> mutations by themselves already cause a signi&#194;&#174;cant defect in        <br /> 60S subunit assembly.

This could be a consequence           <br /> of the almost exclusive presence of 5.8SL rRNA in these cells       <br /> which might be assembled less ef&#194;&#174;ciently than its smaller             <br />                                                                       <br /> counterpart, similar to 3&#194;&#162;-extended 5.8S rRNA (17). This idea        <br /> is supported by the fact that the de&#194;&#174;cit in 60S subunits, in         <br /> particular as judged from the absence of detectable amounts of        <br /> halfmers, is less severe in the rrp5-D4 mutant, which contains       <br /> a higher proportion of 5.8SS rRNA (31; this paper). On the         <br />                                                                       <br /> other hand, the structural abnormality of the Rrp5p protein            <br /> might also directly affect 60S subunit assembly in the            <br /> mutant cells.                                                         <br />    Sucrose gradient analysis of extracts prepared from the       <br />                                                                   <br /> rrp5-D3/rex4&#194;&#177; and rrp5-D3/rex4&#194;&#177; double mutants revealed a         <br /> very low amount of 80S ribosomes (Fig. 7). The combination        <br /> of mutant Rrp5p and the absence of Rex4p, therefore, appears     <br /> to cause a severe defect in ribosome assembly, which would             <br /> explain the sl phenotype of the double mutants. This &#194;&#174;nding             <br />                                                                    <br /> further supports the hypothesis that Rex4p is involved in             <br /> ribosome biogenesis, although its role only becomes manifest         <br /> in the presence of the mutant Rrp5p proteins. We are presently    <br /> studying the role of Rex4p in ribosome biogenesis further             <br />                                                                     <br /> using both genetic and biochemical approaches.                      <br />    In summary, the data presented in this paper &#194;&#174;rmly establish       <br /> the role of the S1 domain of Rrp5p in assisting RNaseMRP in         <br /> </body></html>
