(B) Western blot of <br /> Cdt1&#226;&#8364;&#8220;Myc levels in the mitotic cell cycle after UV irradiation. nda3 cells (P1451) were arrested in mitosis, UV irradiated (100 J/m2) and then released <br /> from the block by shifting to 32 1C. Log-phase extracts are shown for comparison. (C) Nuclear counts for cells in experiment shown in (B) showing <br /> the timing of anaphase. (D) Septation index of cells for experiment shown in (B).

To distinguish between these     after DNA damage (Holmberg et al, 2005; Liu et al, 2005), similar <br />        possibilities, we studied the effects of cycloheximide (CHX) on         to Cdt1. In a cdt2D mutant, Cdt1 is stable after UV irradiation <br />        Cdt1 levels in nda3-arrested cells.

However, UV              high-molecular-weight conjugates of His6&#226;&#8364;&#8220;ubiquitin with Cdt1 <br />        irradiation still led to a decrease in Cdt1 levels when CHX was         was stimulated by UV irradiation, but not in a cdt2D strain <br />        present (Fig 2, &#195;&#190; CHX). This suggests that Cdt1 proteolysis is          (Fig 3E).

By contrast, Kondo et al (2004) have       (Liu et al, 2005). This regulation is clearly different from that of <br />        reported that UV-induced Cdt1 proteolysis is caffeine sensitive,        Cdt1 proteolysis, which does not require synthesis of Cdt2, or <br />        suggesting that ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related             Rad3- and Cds1-dependent checkpoint pathways. <br />        kinase)/ATM might be required in human cells.

We therefore examined whether          existence of a second pathway for proteolysis which is dependent <br />        Ddb1 is involved in this process in S. pombe. Deletion of the ddb1      on Skp2 (Nishitani et al, 2006; Senga et al, 2006). In S. pombe, <br />        gene blocks Cdt1 degradation after UV irradiation of nda3-              Cdt1 proteolysis in S phase has not been well characterized, and <br />        arrested cells (Fig 3C). Thus, a need for Ddb1 in Cdt1 proteolysis      we investigated whether Ddb1 and Cdt2 are relevant. In wild-type <br />        after DNA damage seems to be conserved between S. pombe and             cells expressing yellow fluorescent protein-tagged Cdt1, the <br />  <br />  <br /> 1 1 3 6 EMBO reports   VOL 7 | NO 11 | 2006                                                     &amp;2006 EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY ORGANIZATION <br />  Cdt1 proteolysis in fission yeast <br /> E.

However, the function of Cdt1            Supplementary information is available at EMBO reports online <br />        turnover after DNA damage is less clear. It has been suggested that      (http://www.emboreports.org). <br />        this represents a checkpoint mechanism that delays S-phase entry <br />        (Higa et al, 2003). In S. pombe, UV irradiation has been shown to         <br />        delay the entry of cdc10-arrested (G1) cells into S phase (Nilssen     <br />        et al, 2003). However, Cdt1 does not seem to be relevant to this <br />                                                                                 <br />        delay, as the protein is not detectable in cdc10-arrested cells        <br />        and UV irradiation does not affect Cdt1 induction after release          <br />        (T. Tvega&#203;&#353;rd, B. Grallert, E.A. Nilssen, H. Soltani, S.K. &amp; E.B., <br />        unpublished data). In any case, downregulation of Cdt1 alone <br />                                                                                 <br />        might be problematic as a mechanism to delay S phase, as studies      <br />        in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have suggested that a reduction                  <br />        in the efficiency of pre-RC formation leads to chromosome            <br />        instability, presumably as a result of increased spacing between         <br />        initiation events (Lengronne &amp; Schwob, 2002; Tanaka &amp; Diffley, <br />                                                                              <br />        2002). Cdt1 downregulation could be more effective when                  <br />        coupled to a mechanism delaying S-phase initiation. In mamma-            <br />        lian cells, a defect in ORC function leads to a delay of cyclin E            <br />        expression and S-phase entry, which could represent a checkpoint           <br />        monitoring the efficiency of pre-RC formation (Teer et al, 2006).  <br />        Furthermore, blocking licensing in primary fibroblasts by geminin               <br />        overexpression delays S-phase entry in a manner suggestive of             <br />        a licensing checkpoint (Shreeram et al, 2002).                            <br />            A second explanation is that Cdt1 proteolysis contributes to <br />                                                                                 <br />        efficient DNA repair and error-free DNA replication following              <br />        DNA damage. Ongoing DNA repair might reduce the dNTP pool,               <br />        and downregulation of Cdt1 might reduce the number of            <br />        replication forks in S phase, thus moderating S-phase demand                <br />        on dNTPs.
