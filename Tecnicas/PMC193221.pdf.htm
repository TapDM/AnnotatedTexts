Western blots (immunoblots) of proteins <span id='am-1' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> fractionated cell extracts and immuno- <br />            electron microscopy of the FtsH-overproducing strain showed exclusive localization of the FtsH protein in the <br />            cytoplasmic membrane. Most of the FtsH-specific labeling with gold particles was observed in the cytoplasmic <br />            membrane and the adjacent cytoplasm; much less was observed in the outer membrane and in the bulk <br />            cytoplasm. Genetic analysis by TnphoA insertions intoftsH revealed that the 25- <span id='am-3' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> 95-amino-acid region, which <br />            is flanked by two hydrophobic stretches, protrudes into the periplasmic space. From these results, we <br />            concluded that FtsH protein is an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein spanning the membrane twice and <br />            that it has a large cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal part with a putative ATP-binding domain. The average <br />            number of FtsH molecules per cell was estimated to be approximately 400. <br />  <br />    The nucleotide sequence of the ftsH gene, which is                   AphoA20galEgalKthi rpsE rpoB argE(Am) recAl] (10), and <br /> essential for cell growth, was determined, and the amino                CC202 [CC118/F42 lacI3 zzf-2::TnphoA] (10). <br /> acid sequence of FtsH was deduced (22).

Topological model of FtsH anchored in the cytoplasmic            preferential localization of FtsH at subregions of the cyto- <br /> membrane.

The question remains to be <br />                                                                            solved by further investigations. <br /> 6). These results indicate that FtsH is an integral cytoplas- <br /> mic membrane protein and that it spans the membrane twice                                         <br /> (Fig. 7). In this model, FtsH has a large cytoplasmic domain,                <br /> in which a putative ATP-binding domain exists. Perhaps it is               <br /> an integral membrane ATPase. It should be noticed that the                <br /> overall structural features of FtsH resemble those of integral              <br /> membrane components of signal transduction systems, e.g.,                   <br /> EnvZ (4), Tar (8), and Tsr (11), although a homology search                   <br /> did not show any significant similarity of FtsH to these                  <br /> proteins.                                                                   <br />    FtsH showed significant homology to a novel family of                    <br /> eukaryotic ATPases (22). The region showing homology                       <br /> extends over some 200 amino acid residues, including a                                                  <br /> putative ATP-binding sequence and the adjacent C-terminal <br /> sequence. In contrast to FtsH, all of the eukaryotic members              <br /> of this family do not seem to be integral membrane proteins.                <br />                                                                               <br /> It is noteworthy, however, that some of them are associated              <br /> with the membrane (e.g., NSF/Secl8p) or related to mem-                     <br /> brane function (e.g., Pasip). Both prokaryotic and eukary-               <br /> otic members of this family may somehow be involved in                       <br /> essential membrane functions (22).                                        <br />    We have found that the ftsHl(Ts) mutation causes a                         <br /> decrease in the amount of PBP3 at 420C (2). It has been                  <br /> shown that FtsH protein is involved in proper folding,                     <br /> assembly, or topogenesis for PBP3 (21).
