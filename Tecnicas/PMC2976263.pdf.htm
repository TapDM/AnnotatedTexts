Knockdown of expression <br />           of S2 protein in Sf21 cells resulted in reduced toxicity of the Vip3A protein. These observations were further <br />           extended to adult fifth-instar larvae of Spodoptera litura.

These observations have been <br /> formation of S2-specific 21-mer siRNA only in the dsRNA-                    further strengthened by data obtained from larvae that had <br /> injected larvae (Fig. 7C).                                                  been injected with S2 dsRNA. These S2-silenced larvae dis- <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> played reduced toxicity against Vip3A exposure and concom-                  <br /> itant reduction in the abundance of S2 protein expression.                  <br />    One of the common features of the toxicity of bacillary insec-                                         <br /> ticidal proteins is that their ingestion by susceptible insect results        <br /> in the lysis of epithelial tissue of the midgut. Ultrastructural visu-         <br /> alization of Vip3A-ingested midgut tissue of susceptible larvae             <br /> also revealed extensive disintegration of epithelial tissue as a         <br /> consequence of pore formation (12).                                      <br />    In the recent times, concern has been raised about the pos-                  <br /> sibile emergence of resistance in insects against insecticidal               <br /> proteins. One of the possible strategies suggested to overcome           <br /> such a threat is the pyramiding of insecticidal toxin proteins               <br /> that are active against same target insect. Since Spodoptera                 <br /> species are sensitive to the insecticidal proteins Cry1C and              <br /> Vip3A, we examined the cross-reactivities of these proteins            <br /> with corresponding receptor proteins. The retention of sensi-           <br /> tivity to the insecticidal protein Cry1C in S2-silenced Sf21 cells           <br /> suggested that Cry1C does not interact with the S2 protein.                      <br /> This finding is in agreement with our earlier results, wherein                <br /> we demonstrated interaction of Cry1C with APN (1, 2, 17).                <br /> Thus, the divergence of receptors for Cry1C and Vip3A offers                  <br /> a potentially useful combination of insecticidal proteins for                  <br /> integration into strategies for delaying the onset of resistance       <br /> to insecticidal proteins by Spodoptera.                                         <br />    Although Vip3A interacts with S2 protein, the precise mech-                 <br /> anism of access of Vip3A to the S2 protein and consequent cell         <br /> lysis is difficult to speculate. Nevertheless, results obtained by                <br /> confocal microscopy demonstrate that Vip3A toxin at a non-                 <br /> lethal concentration preferentially localizes on the cell surfaces        <br /> of Sf21 cells. Most importantly, S2 protein is also visualized on        <br /> the surfaces of Sf21 cells. Thus, S2-Vip3A interaction is evi-         <br /> dent on the surfaces of insect cells initially and subsequently in         <br /> the cytoplasm of cells that are beginning to lyse. That this                <br /> interaction is mainly localized at the cell surface and in the              <br /> cytoplasm and is absent in the nuclei is evident from the results        <br /> of nuclear DAPI staining. In Sf21 cells that are exposed to a             <br /> lethal concentration of Vip3A or are incubated longer in a               <br /> sublethal concentration of Vip3A, a direct interaction of                    <br /> Vip3A with S2 can be seen at all surfaces of cells and in the         <br /> cytoplasm. This Vip3A-S2 protein interaction triggers the lysis                 <br /> of Sf21 cells. The subsequent action of the S2-Vip3A adjunct in               <br /> the disruption of the membrane and the formation of the pore                   <br /> is not clear. The precise cellular function of S2 protein is not                <br /> clearly defined; nevertheless, it has been speculated to modu-                  <br /> late diverse pathways, including the methylation of the lamin-                 <br /> inlike receptor, the control of oogenesis in Drosophila melano-                  <br /> gaster, and the suppression of ribosomal protein synthesis to                    <br /> trigger apoptosis (3, 6, 15, 20). It will be interesting to unravel        <br /> the subsequent action of S2-Vip3A in disrupting the mem-                          <br /> brane structures of susceptible insect larvae.                                  <br /> </body></html>
