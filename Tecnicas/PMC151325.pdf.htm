This is also true when you compare the overall <br /> backbone trace of apo-tbSecA with the structure of the protein <br /> with bound ADP-&#226;&#65533;&#164;-S, suggesting that the ADP binding does not <br /> significantly change the structure. The only minor backbone <br /> differences were observed in the regions of the C-terminal core <br /> helices. Electron density maps calculated with data from crystals <br /> of the tbSecA:ADP-&#226;&#65533;&#164;-S:Mg2&#226;&#171;&#185; complex show clear electron <br /> density for a single molecule of the ADP analog, and the Mg2&#226;&#171;&#185; <br /> bound at the interface between NBD1 and NBD2 of the motor <br /> domain. Three side chains (Q80, D493, and D501) that interact <br /> with ADP-&#226;&#65533;&#164;-S show significant conformational differences be- <br /> tween the apo and ADP-&#226;&#65533;&#164;-S-bound forms of the proteins. <br />    Superimposition of our structure with bsSecA (802 residues) <br /> structure shows it shares a similar fold (rmsd of 2.47 &#195;&#8230; for <br /> 720 C&#226;&#65533;&#163; atoms). [See Superimposition of Mycobacterial SecA1 <br /> (tbSecA) with Bacillus subtilis SecA (bsSecA) in Supporting Text <br /> and Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the <br /> PNAS web site.] The smaller size of bsSecA is primarily due to <br /> the absence of &#226;&#65533;&#163;20 and &#226;&#65533;&#163;21, which are not found in the SecA <br /> sequences of Gram-negative bacteria. The structure of tbSecA <br /> was clearly visible for the 148 residues marked as unreliable in <br /> the bsSecA structure.
