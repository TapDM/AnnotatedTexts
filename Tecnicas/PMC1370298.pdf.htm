In S. cerevisiae, a subcomplex of the spliceosome that includes Cef1p can be <br /> isolated on its own; this has been termed the nineteen complex (Ntc) because it contains Prp19p. Components of the <br /> Ntc include Cef1p, Snt309p, Syf2p/Ntc31p, Ntc30p/Isy1p, Ntc20p and at least six unidentified proteins. We recently <br /> identified ;30 proteins that copurified with Cdc5p and Cef1p. Previously unidentified S. pombe proteins in this <br /> purification were called Cwfs for complexed with five and novel S. cerevisiae proteins were called Cwcs for com- <br /> plexed with Cef1p. Using these proteomics data coupled with available information regarding Ntc composition, we <br /> have investigated protein identities and interactions among Ntc components. Our data indicate that Cwc2p, Prp46p, <br /> Clf1p, and Syf1p most likely represent Ntc40p, Ntc50p, Ntc77p, and Ntc90p, respectively. We show that Sc Cwc2p <br /> interacts with Prp19p and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Sp cwf2 + , the homolog of Sc CWC2, is allelic with the <br /> previously identified Sp prp3 + . We present evidence that Sp Cwf7p, an essential protein with obvious homologs in <br /> many eukaryotes but not S. cerevisiae, is a functional counterpart of Sc Snt309p and binds Sp Cwf8p (a homolog of <br /> Sc Prp19p). Further, our data indicate that a <span id='am-88' about='Thesaurus:TESSE01' typeof='owl:Thing'><span id='am-89' property="rdfs:label" content="Knock-out" datatype="rdf:PlainLiteral"></span><span
