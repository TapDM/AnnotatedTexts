We have confronted yeast <br />                               cells carrying a rewired regulatory circuit with a severe and unforeseen <br />                               challenge. The essential HIS3 gene <span id='am-5' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> the histidine biosynthesis pathway was <br />                               placed under the exclusive regulation of the galactose utilization system. <br />                               Glucose containing medium strongly represses the GAL genes including HIS3 <br />                               and these rewired cells are required to operate this essential gene. We show here <br />                               that although there were no adapted cells prior to the encounter with glucose, a <br />                               large fraction of cells adapted to grow in this medium and this adaptation was <br />                               stably inherited. The adaptation relied on individual cells that switched into an <br />                               adapted state and, thus, the adaptation was due to a response of many individual <br />                               cells to the change in environment and not due to selection of rare advantageous <br />                               phenotypes. The adaptation of numerous individual cells by heritable phenotypic <br />                               switching in response to a challenge extends the common evolutionary <br />                               framework and attests to the adaptive potential of regulatory circuits. <br />                               [DOI: 10.2976/1.3353782] <br />  <br />  <br /> CORRESPONDENCE                    Organisms and cells exhibit significant ad-       and Delbruck, 1943; Paquin and Adams, 1983; <br /> Erez Braun:                   aptation capabilities to diverse environmental        Lenski and Travisano, 1994; Drake et al., 1998; <br /> erez@physics.technion.ac.il <br />                               conditions as evident by the realized biodiver-       Marini et al., 1999; Elena and Lenski, 2003; <br />                               sity.
