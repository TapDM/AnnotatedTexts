To exclude the latter possibility, we carried out                            experimentally. On the basis of fluorescence studies to <br /> control experiments using NBD-labelled UDP-MurNAc-penta-                                    assay the transport of NBD-Lipid II across bacterial inner <br /> peptide that was present in the lumen of the vesicles.

Moreover, our findings argue against the latest reports <br /> Addition of vancomycin-TMR yielded a higher FRET signal                                     that proposed MviN (MurJ) as the putative Lipid II flippase <br /> in the presence of FtsW than in the control situations;                                     (Inoue et al, 2008; Ruiz, 2008). In this respect, our results are <br /> protein-free vesicles and vesicles reconstituted with KcsA                                  consistent with the finding that was very recently reported, <br /> (Figure 7). This result can be understood in the following                                  describing that MviN homologues in B. subtilis are not <br /> way. Whereas in vesicles devoid of transporter (no protein or                               essential for growth and do not seem to have a role as the <br /> with KcsA), the vancomycin-TMR can bind to only half the                                    flippase of Lipid II (Fay and Dworkin, 2009).
