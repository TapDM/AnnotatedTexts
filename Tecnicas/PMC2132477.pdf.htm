A probe from this region was physically mapped <br />     For ProA-Mps1p kinase assays, cultures were grown at 258 or 388C, and        by hybridization to the overlapping set of l genomic clones <br /> 6 3 108 cells were collected for each assay. Cells were disrupted by vortex-     (Riles et al., 1993).

The lysate was clarified by centrifuging for 10 min at 13,000 g at <br /> 48C, and the supernatant was incubated with 5% IgG-Sepharose (Pharma-            5219 (American Type Culture Collection clone 70543), on <br /> cia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ) for 2 h at 48C.

(b) The same <br /> strain was arrested at Start with a-factor at 258C and then released from this arrest at 388C. Samples were taken at the arrest (0 h) and at <br /> 1-h intervals (1 h&#226;&#8364;&#8220;4 h). The cells again remain G1 arrested. Drifting of the G1 peak to the right is eliminated when the experiment is per- <br /> formed with rho8 derivatives of AS158-2a, indicating that the drift results from accumulation of mitochondrial DNA as the cells become <br /> enlarged, not from progression into S phase (not shown). In the control (C; filled curve), a-factor&#226;&#8364;&#8220;arrested cells were released at 258C <br /> and sampled at 4 h. The cells have recovered from a-factor arrest and show a typical G1 and G2/M distribution of DNA content. In <br /> these histograms, the x-axis is the relative DNA content determined by propidium iodide fluorescence, and the y-axis is the relative <br /> number of cells (Materials and Methods). Each sample represents 10,000 cells. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 136, 1997                             974 <br />  ibly blocks SPB duplication at the satellite-bearing SPB <br /> stage (Fig. 2 a). The reciprocal shift used two distinct <br /> methods to block the cell cycle, a-factor and cdc37 arrest, <br /> first in one order and then in the reciprocal order. Behav- <br /> ior of the cells in response to these manipulations allows <br /> us to compare the timing of a-factor arrest relative to <br /> cdc37 arrest. For the first shift, a population of log phase <br /> cdc37-1 cells (AS158-2a; Table I) was arrested in G1 by in- <br /> cubation at the nonpermissive temperature. The cells were <br /> then returned to the permissive temperature in the pres- <br /> ence of an excess of a-factor. Cell cycle progression was <br /> monitored by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content <br /> and by cell morphology. In this experiment, the cells re- <br /> mained arrested in G1 (Fig. 3 a), indicating that the cdc ar- <br /> rest point must be before or equivalent to a-factor arrest. <br />    In the reciprocal experiment, log phase cultures of the <br /> same strain were exposed to a-factor at room temperature <br /> to arrest them at Start. Cells were then removed from mat- <br /> ing pheromone and placed at the nonpermissive tempera- <br /> ture, and cell cycle progression was monitored as de- <br /> scribed above. The cells remained arrested in G1 (Fig. 3 b), <br /> indicating that the arrest must be subsequent or equivalent <br /> to a-mating pheromone arrest. Integration of data from <br /> both halves of the reciprocal shift confirms the previous <br /> observation that the cdc37-1 arrest point is equivalent to, <br /> or interdependent with, Start. However, because of the <br /> duplicated or partially duplicated nature of the SPBs, this <br /> represents a novel Start arrest. <br />  <br /> Epistatic Relationship between CDC37 and MPS1 <br /> Although CDC37 and MPS1 have been found to interact <br /> genetically, mutations in these two genes have distinct cell <br /> cycle and SPB phenotypes. The epistatic relationship be- <br /> tween cdc37 and mps1 was examined with respect to both <br /> phenotypes. All eight viable combinations between cdc37-1 <br /> and the six alleles of mps1 (Table II) were shifted to the <br /> nonpermissive temperature to examine their cell cycle phe- <br /> notype. An mps1 single mutant strain shows no delay in <br /> cell cycle progression at high temperature (Winey et al., <br /> 1991). In contrast, all cdc37-1 mps1 double mutant strains <br /> arrested in G1 as a cdc37-1 single mutant would (Fig. 4 a). <br /> Thus, cdc37-1 is epistatic to mps1 for cell cycle phenotype. <br /> SPB morphology was examined in one of these strains, a <br /> cdc37-1 mps1-1237 double mutant (AS153-12d; Table I). <br /> The double mutant strain was incubated at the nonpermis-         Figure 4.

Movement <br /> isting SPB had been assembled before CDC37 function                 of the defective SPB to a distal location in an mps2 single <br /> was lost and presumably remained intact.

The aberrant SPB structures in mps2 and cdc37 strains are shown branching off from the <br /> pathway at the same point. Because mps2 cdc37 double mutant strains display a synthetic phenotype rather than a clear epistatic rela- <br /> tionship, the execution points of these two genes cannot be ordered relative to one another. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> al., 1995; Caplan et al., 1995; Kimura et al., 1995; Dey et al.,      gesting that their properties resemble those of the wild- <br /> 1996a); it also requires CDC37 function (Boschelli et al.,            type protein.

Winey, unpublished observa- <br /> member of the Hsp90 family) has the same effect (Cut-                 tion). Cdc37p might actually do its work one or more steps <br /> forth and Rubin, 1994).                                               away from Mps1p in the SPB duplication pathway, per- <br />    A chaperone function for mammalian Cdc37 has re-                   haps by stabilizing an upstream kinase, and thus we would <br /> cently been demonstrated directly.

This rela- <br /> have found that Cdc37 is the long-known but previously                tionship could be complex; even if Cdc37p does act di- <br /> unidentified p50 subunit of the Hsp90 molecular chaper-               rectly on Mps1p, it may also have indirect effects on Mps1p <br /> one complex, and they suggest that this protein targets               activity through modulation of other G1 kinases, possibly <br /> Hsp90 to the Cdk4 kinase. Cdc37/Hsp90 binds the fraction              including Cdc28p. Experimental evaluation of the relative <br /> of Cdk4 that is not associated with cyclins, and pharmaco-            contributions of direct and indirect effects may be difficult. <br /> logical disruption of Cdc37/Hsp90 function in cultured                   Multiple requirements for CDC37 function in the cell <br /> cells decreases Cdk4 half-life.

We <br /> Hsp90 complex and are destabilized when that complex is               and others have shown that the cdc37-1 mutation reduces <br /> inactivated (Whitesel et al., 1994; Nathan and Lindquist,             the in vitro kinase activity of both Cdc28p and Mps1p, en- <br /> 1995; Schulte et al., 1995).                                          zymes that are required for these events and act very close <br />    Does this stability mechanism hold true in yeast?

Although kinase stability is affected in both in-          cause confusion about the G1 status of a cdc37-1 cell. In <br /> stances, destabilization may not be the primary reason for            this situation, some aspects of the cell cycle would be <br /> loss of kinase activity in the cell. Cdc28p levels do drop            blocked at Start, but residual Cdc28p activity might be suf- <br /> somewhat in cdc37-1 cells, but while reduction in kinase              ficient to trigger the SPB duplication pathway. Why then <br /> activity is temperature dependent, the reduced protein                would SPB duplication not proceed to completion? The <br /> level is not. At the nonpermissive temperature, Cdc28p is             structural and genetic evidence presented here suggests <br /> still present in excess over the Cln2p cyclin but does not            that CDC37 functions downstream of MPS1, since a <br /> bind normally to it, suggesting a role for Cdc37p in assem-           cdc37-1 mutant proceeds considerably farther in SPB du- <br /> bly of active kinase complexes (Gerber et al., 1995). In the          plication than an mps1-1 mutant does before the process <br /> case of pp60v-src, cdc37 and hsp90 mutations can influence            stalls, but the requirement of CDC37 for Mps1p kinase ac- <br /> both accumulation and activity of the kinase, but these ef-           tivity contradicts this interpretation. We propose that the <br /> fects are distinct and separable (Nathan and Lindquist,               cdc37-1 SPB phenotype arises from significant but not <br /> 1995; Dey et al., 1996b). We now report that Mps1p kinase             complete loss of Mps1p kinase activity. Phenotypic analy- <br /> activity, but not stability, depends upon CDC37 function.             sis of mps1 alleles indicates that this kinase is required not <br /> Although the epitope tags we used to monitor Mps1p                    only to begin SPB duplication, but also to carry it to com- <br /> could potentially affect stability, these proteins were func-         pletion (Schutz, A., and M.

At the nonpermissive temperature, a cdc37-1 mu- <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> tant strain may retain sufficient kinase activity to initiate                    <br /> duplication, but too little to actually finish the process.                         <br />    This study addresses G1 functions of CDC37, but this                                <br /> gene may also be important in other stages of the cell cy-                            <br /> cle. The alleles discussed here were specifically selected                           <br /> for their behavior at Start (Reed 1980a, b) and may not ad-                 <br /> dress all the requirements for CDC37. Several of the pro-                         <br /> tein kinases intimate with CDC37 perform functions later                          <br /> in the cell cycle, raising the possibility that CDC37 could                     <br /> also be important after G1. Mps1p participates in a spindle                   <br /> assembly checkpoint in G2/M (Weiss and Winey, 1996),                                     <br /> and casein kinase II is also required around this time                            <br /> (Hanna et al., 1995). Similarly, Cdc28p is required to pro-                              <br /> mote cell cycle progression not only at Start, but also in                   <br /> S phase and in G2/M (for review see Nasmyth, 1993; Fig. 9).                  <br /> Gerber et al. (1995) report biochemical evidence for a                                 <br /> CDC37 requirement in G2/M: cdc37-1 mutant strains also                           <br /> exhibit a defect in binding and activation of Cdc28p by the                        <br /> mitotic cyclin Clb2p. The recent isolation of CDC37 alleles                           <br /> that affect pp60v-src activity and cause a G2/M cell cycle ar-                    <br /> rest provides genetic evidence to bolster this idea (Dey et                           <br /> al., 1996b). A variety of alleles of this gene may be needed                          <br /> to explore and understand the functions of CDC37 in G1                                <br /> and throughout the cell cycle.                                                         <br /> </body></html>
