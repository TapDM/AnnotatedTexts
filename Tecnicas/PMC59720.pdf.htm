Here, we report the first in vivo analysis of microtubule dynamics in cells lacking a <br />         member of this protein family. For these studies, we have used a conditional Stu2p depletion <br />         strain expressing &#226;&#65533;&#163;-tubulin fused <span id='am-3' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> green fluorescent protein. Depletion of Stu2p leads to fewer <br />         and less dynamic cytoplasmic microtubules in both G1 and preanaphase cells. The reduction in <br />         cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics is due primarily to decreases in both the catastrophe and <br />         rescue frequencies and an increase in the fraction of time microtubules spend pausing. These <br />         changes have significant consequences for the cell because they impede the ability of cytoplasmic <br />         microtubules to orient the spindle. In addition, recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching <br />         indicates that kinetochore microtubules are no longer dynamic in the absence of Stu2p. This <br />         deficiency is correlated with a failure to properly align chromosomes at metaphase. Overall, we <br />         provide evidence that Stu2p promotes the dynamics of microtubule plus-ends in vivo and that <br />         these dynamics are critical for microtubule interactions with kinetochores and cortical sites in the <br />         cytoplasm. <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                          vitro have been identified, their relative importance and <br />                                                                       precise roles in vivo are not yet well understood. <br /> The dynamic nature of the microtubule cytoskeleton is es-                Individual microtubules exhibit stochastic transitions be- <br /> sential for its function in a variety of cellular processes such      tween states of growth and shrinkage, a behavior known as <br /> as organelle organization and chromosome segregation.

Elimination of the spindle checkpoint does allow <br />                                                                    <br /> cells to progress through the cell cycle but does not abrogate <br /> the spindle elongation defect, indicating that Stu2p plays a        <br /> structural role in spindle elongation. Stu2p-depleted cells         <br />                                                                   <br /> also fail to elongate spindles. A few Stu2p-depleted cells <br /> begin spindle elongation, but these spindles break at &#226;&#172;&#402;3&#226;&#8364;&#8220;5         <br /> &#226;&#65533;&#174;m in length. This breakage could be due to a weak arrange-       <br /> ment of polar microtubules or to a defect in elongating these      <br /> microtubules once anaphase begins. We have not been able           <br /> to measure the effect of Stu2p depletion on the dynamics of        <br /> polar microtubules. But given that Stu2p promotes the dy-           <br /> namics of cytoplasmic and kinetochore microtubules, it            <br /> seems reasonable to propose that Stu2p may promote the              <br /> dynamics of polar microtubules as well. Consistent with this      <br /> hypothesis, Stu2p localizes to the midregion of spindles,          <br /> where the plus-ends of the polar microtubules reside. As            <br /> polar microtubules must find their counterparts from the           <br /> opposite pole, decreasing microtubule dynamics could im-           <br /> pede this process and lead to the assembly of defective            <br /> spindles that are unable to elongate. Alternatively, Stu2p        <br /> may be involved in the switch that allows polar microtu- <br />                                                                     <br /> bules to lengthen at anaphase B onset. Although Stu2p de-           <br /> pletion does not alter the length of cytoplasmic microtu-          <br /> bules, it may have a different effect on polar microtubules.       <br /> The nucleus and the cytoplasm likely contain distinct sets of <br />                                                                   <br /> proteins capable of influencing microtubule dynamics, so            <br /> the relative contribution of Stu2p to microtubule assembly          <br /> may differ in these two compartments.                              <br />                                                                     <br /> Stu2p and XMAP215                                                   <br />                                                                     <br /> Contrary to the role of XMAP215 that dampens microtubule            <br /> dynamics in Xenopus extracts, Stu2p promotes microtubule <br /> dynamics in yeast. These opposite effects may reflect differ-      <br /> ences in the intrinsic activities of these two proteins, a prop- <br />                                                                    <br /> erty that has not yet been determined for Stu2p. However, it <br /> seems likely that this discrepancy results, at least in part,       <br /> from differences in growing yeast cells and Xenopus egg             <br /> extracts. Microtubules in yeast are considerably less dy-           <br /> namic than microtubules in Xenopus extracts and animal              <br /> cells in general (Carminati and Stearns, 1997; Shaw et al.,         <br /> 1997b). This is probably due in part to the fact that tubulin       <br /> from yeast is inherently less dynamic than tubulin from             <br /> </body></html>
