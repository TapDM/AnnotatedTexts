/>     In the United States, Ixodes scapularis ticks overwinter in the Northeast and Upper Midwest and transmit the <br />     agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, among other pathogens. We now show <br />     that the presence of A. phagocytophilum in I. scapularis ticks increases their ability to survive in the cold. We <br />     identified an I. scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein, designated IAFGP, and demonstrated via RNAi knockdown <br />     studies the importance of IAFGP for the survival of I. scapularis ticks in a cold environment. Transfection <br />     studies also show that IAFGP increased the viability of yeast cells subjected to cold temperature. Remark- <br />     ably, A. phagocytophilum induced the expression of iafgp, thereby increasing the cold tolerance and survival of	 <br />     I. scapularis. These data define a molecular basis for symbiosis between a human pathogenic bacterium and <br />     its arthropod vector and delineate what we believe to be a new pathway that may be targeted to alter the life <br />     cycle of this microbe and its invertebrate host. <br />  <br /> Introduction                                                                                 these processes elicits different adaptive responses, and specific <br /> Diverse arthropods have intimate relationships with microbes                                 antifreeze proteins are involved (20&#226;&#8364;&#8220;22). Antifreeze proteins are a <br /> (1&#226;&#8364;&#8220;5). Several examples include pheromonal symbiosis of desert                               diverse class of compounds that bind to ice crystals and restrict <br /> locusts (6) and nutritional symbiosis of flower thrips (7) with                              their growth (23&#226;&#8364;&#8220;26). Antifreeze proteins require structural com- <br /> environmentally acquired bacteria.

AFPs and AFGPs <br /> Arthropods also transmit microbes to vertebrates, sometimes                                  are divided into 4 and 8 subtypes, respectively (24, 29, 30).

Higher molecular mass glycoproteins of 20 to 33 kDa are <br /> ria that cause disease in man, including Anaplasma phagocytophilum,                          referred to as AFGPs 1 to 4, and those less than 20 kDa are referred <br /> the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (12&#226;&#8364;&#8220;16).
