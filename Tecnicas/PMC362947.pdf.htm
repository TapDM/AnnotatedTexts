There are two known <br /> yeast G,, proteins; GPAI is involved in mating pheromone               <br /> signal transduction (10, 22), whereas the function of GPA2 is      <br /> unknown, and mutations in GPA2 result in no discernible        <br /> phenotype (25). If ARF were required for GPAI function,           <br /> then sterility or constitutive activation of the mating path-    <br /> way might be expected, but neither of these phenotypes was         <br /> observed in either arfi null mutants or under conditions of      <br /> ARF depletion (see Results; also, unpublished observation).       <br /> A caveat of this interpretation is that the known secretion <br /> defect of arf mutants might prevent the observation of the                          <br /> morphological changes associated with activation of the         <br /> mating pathway. If ARF were required solely for GPA2            <br /> function, then ARF might be expected to be dispensable, but        <br /> we have shown that ARF is essential. We have not ruled out      <br /> the possibility that ARF is involved with GPA2 function,          <br /> only that this cannot be the sole function of ARF, nor have           <br /> we addressed whether the in vitro GOS ADP-ribosylation         <br /> assay is actually relevant to in vivo function. Further,             <br /> cholera toxin has been reported to have no effect on yeast            <br /> adenylate cyclase and no protein acceptor of ADP-ribose has             <br /> been identified in yeast extracts (7). Our results do clearly      <br /> demonstrate that the level of ARF protein is critical for          <br /> proper function. Either underexpression or overexpression             <br /> of ARF protein results in impaired growth or complete          <br /> cessation of growth, depending on the degree of alteration.        <br />    The fluoride sensitivity of arf mutants is intriguing. Al-        <br /> though a model for the mechanism of activation of the a                 <br /> subunits of the trimeric G proteins by fluoride complexes has       <br /> been proposed (2), there is no evidence that fluoride or                <br /> aluminum fluoride complexes bind to or activate any of the          <br /> low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins. For the trimer-         <br /> ic G proteins, it is believed that AlF4- is the active species      <br /> for the activating effect (44), resulting from the resemblance       <br /> of this compound to the gamma phosphate of GTP.
