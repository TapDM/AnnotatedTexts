This change affected a residue that is conserved <span id='am-1' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> <br /> humans to yeast and cosegregated with the disease in the family in which it was identified. Lymphoblasts derived from patients with this <br /> mutation showed abnormal localization of endogenous PRPF6 within the nucleus. Specifically, this protein accumulated in the Cajal <br /> bodies, indicating a possible impairment in the tri-snRNP assembly or recycling. Expression of GFP-tagged PRPF6 in HeLa cells showed <br /> that this phenomenon depended exclusively on the mutated form of the protein. Furthermore, analysis of endogenous transcripts in <br /> cells from patients revealed intron retention for pre-mRNA bearing specific splicing signals, according to the same <span id='am-238' about='xsp:pattern' typeof='owl:Thing'>pattern</span> displayed <br /> by lymphoblasts with mutations in other PRPF genes. Our results identify PRPF6 as the sixth gene involved in pre-mRNA splicing <br /> and dominant RP, corroborating the hypothesis that deficiencies in the spliceosome play an important role in the molecular pathology <br /> of this disease. <br />  <br /> Mutations in more than 50 genes cause retinitis pigmentosa                involve the dynamic assembly and disassembly of snRNP <br /> (RP [MIM 268000]), a form of retinal degeneration with an                 subcomplexes.
