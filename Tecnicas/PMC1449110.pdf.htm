TOR is also known as the target <br />              protein for the immunosuppressive and potentially anticancer drug rapamycin. The fission yeast Schizosac- <br />              charomyces pombe has two TOR homologs. tor1&#226;&#171;&#185; is required under starvation and a variety of stresses, while <br />              tor2&#226;&#171;&#185; is an essential gene. Surprisingly, to date no rapamycin-sensitive TOR-dependent function has been <br />              identified in S. pombe. Herein, we show that S. pombe auxotrophs, in particular leucine auxotrophs, are <br />              sensitive to rapamycin. This sensitivity is suppressed by deletion of the S. pombe FKBP12 or by introducing <br />              a rapamycin-binding defective tor1 allele, suggesting that rapamycin inhibits a tor1p-dependent function. <br />              Sensitivity of leucine auxotrophs to rapamycin is observed when ammonia is used as the nitrogen source <br />              and can be suppressed by its replacement with proline. Consistently, using radioactive labeled leucine, <br />              we show that cells treated with rapamycin or disrupted for tor1&#226;&#171;&#185; are defective in leucine uptake when the <br />              nitrogen source is ammonia but not proline. Recently, it has been reported that tsc1&#226;&#171;&#185; and tsc2&#226;&#171;&#185;, the S. <br />              pombe homologs for the mammalian TSC1 and TSC2, are also defective in leucine uptake. TSC1 and TSC2 <br />              may antagonize TOR signaling in mammalian cells and Drosophila. We show that reduction of leucine <br />              uptake in tor1 mutants is correlated with decreased expression of three putative amino acid permeases <br />              that are also downregulated in tsc1 or tsc2. These findings suggest a possible mechanism for regulation <br />              of leucine uptake by tor1p and indicate that tor1p, as well as tsc1p and tsc2p, positively regulates leucine <br />              uptake in S. pombe. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> T    HE TOR (target of r apamycin) kinases form an evolu- <br />      tionary conserved family of large proteins with a ki- <br /> nase domain that resembles phosphatidylinositide (PI) <br />                                                                              variety of human tumors (Bjornsti and Houghton <br />                                                                              2004; Fingar and Blenis 2004). Rapamycin binds and <br />                                                                              inhibits TOR kinases when in complex with FKBP12, a <br /> PI-3 and PI-4 kinases and are therefore referred to as PI3K-                 ubiquitous 12-kD prolyl-isomerase.

Two leucine-uptake systems <br /> were identified in S. pombe, a high- and a low-affinity <br /> system (Sychrova et al. 1989). We first measured leu- <br /> cine uptake in media that contains ammonia as the <br /> nitrogen source (EMM) in the presence of 0.01 mm <br /> leucine, conditions under which only the high-affinity <br /> system is expected to transport leucine at a significant <br /> capacity (Karagiannis et al. 1999; Matsumoto et al. <br /> 2002). As shown in Figure 5A, the uptake of rapamycin- <br /> treated cells was &#226;&#181;&#8216;40% of the untreated wild-type cells. <br /> Similarly, the rate of uptake by &#226;&#338;&#172;tor1 cells was &#226;&#181;&#8216;40% of <br /> the wild-type cells. We also measured leucine uptake in <br /> EMM media in the presence of 2 mm leucine, conditions <br /> under which both systems are expected to import leu- <br /> cine, although the majority of leucine uptake can be <br /> attributed to the function of the low-affinity system <br /> (Karagiannis et al. 1999; Matsumoto et al. 2002). In <br /> the presence of 2 mm leucine, leucine uptake by rapa- <br /> mycin-treated cells is reduced to &#226;&#181;&#8216;50% of the untreated <br /> wild-type strain, while leucine uptake by &#226;&#338;&#172;tor1 cells is <br /> even further reduced to &#226;&#181;&#8216;30% of the wild-type strain <br /> (Figure 5B). Importantly, uptake of radioactively la- <br /> beled leucine was not reduced when cells treated with <br /> rapamycin or deleted for tor1 were grown in medium <br /> containing proline instead of ammonia (Figure 5C), <br /> consistent with our observation that the growth of leucine <br /> auxotrophs is not inhibited on proline plates (Figure 3B). <br /> Taken together, we conclude that rapamycin-treated or <br /> &#226;&#338;&#172;tor1 cells grown in ammonia-containing medium are de- <br /> fective in leucine uptake. In contrast, leucine uptake is <br /> not significantly reduced in rapamycin-treated or &#226;&#338;&#172;tor1           Figure 5.&#226;&#8364;&#8221;Wild-type cells treated with rapamycin or &#226;&#338;&#172;tor1 <br /> cells grown in proline-containing medium.                      cells are defective in leucine uptake.
