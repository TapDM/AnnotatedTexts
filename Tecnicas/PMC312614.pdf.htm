Inositol-phosphoryl ceramide synthase 1 (Ipc1) is a fungus-specific enzyme, encoded by the essential <br /> IPC1 gene, that catalyzes the formation of complex sphingolipids and may also regulate the levels of <br /> phytoceramide and diacylglycerol. Here, we investigated the functions of this essential gene by modulating its <br /> expression in C. neoformans using a galactose-inducible promoter. Down-regulation of IPC1 significantly <br /> lowers the expression of certain virulence traits such as melanin pigmentation and, remarkably, impairs <br /> pathogenicity of C. neoformans in an established rabbit model. Interestingly, we found that IPC1 <br /> down-regulation significantly decreases the intracellular growth of C. neoformans in the J774.16 murine <br /> macrophage-like cells. Finally, we studied the effect of IPC1 expression under different stress conditions and <br /> found that down-regulation of IPC1 confers a defect on in vitro growth at low pH. Because this environment <br /> is similar <span id='am-4' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> that in the phagolysosome of J774.16 macrophage-like cells, our findings indicate that <br /> down-regulation of IPC1 confers a growth defect in vivo through a pH-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, <br /> our study is the first to define a novel and crucial function of Ipc1 in fungal pathogenesis. <br /> [Key Words: sphingolipids; Cryptococcus neoformans; virulence] <br /> Received October 2, 2000; revised version accepted November 29, 2000. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> Cryptococcus neoformans is a common invasive oppor-                 isms are characterized by the presence of sphingolipids, <br /> tunistic pathogen in AIDS patients, and it is the most              differences between yeast and mammals throughout the <br /> common cause of fungal meningitis worldwide (Casade-                biosynthetic pathways have been described (Mandala et <br /> vall and Perfect 1998).

RT-PCR products were sepa- <br /> rated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel <br /> and stained with ethidium bromide.

Rabbits                 <br /> were sedated with ketamine and xylazine on days 4, 7, 11, and              <br /> 14 after inoculation, and CSF was withdrawn. Quantitative               <br /> yeast cultures were performed by diluting the CSF in PBS, plat-            <br /> ing on YPD medium, and incubating for 72 h at 30&#194;&#176;C.                      <br />  <br /> Intracellular growth in J774.16 macrophage-like cell line <br />                                                                           <br /> J774.16 is a murine reticulum sarcoma macrophage-like cell                <br /> line that has been extensively characterized (Chang et al. 1992).       <br /> The intracellular growth of C. neoformans into J774.16 macro-           <br /> phage-like cells was studied as previously described (Mukherjee         <br /> et al. 1995; Mukherjee et al. 1996; Cox et al., in prep.). In brief,    <br /> J774.16 cells were used up to passage #10, with each passage               <br /> dilution equal to 1:15. Cells were plated on 35 &#195;&#8212; 10-mm plates           <br /> (Constar Corp.) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with                  <br /> 10% fetal calf serum and 1&#195;&#8212; penicillin/streptomycin at 37&#194;&#176;C             <br /> with 10% CO2. Just before the infection, 2 mL of the fresh              <br /> medium containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose was added to                <br /> the cells. Then, 50 units/mL of IFN-&#226;&#65533;&#165; (Genzyme Corp.), 0.3              <br /> &#194;&#181;g/mL of LPS (Sigma Chemical Co.), and 10 &#194;&#181;g/mL of 18B7                  <br /> (IgG-specific anti-GXM monoclonal antibody) were added to the              <br /> cells. Finally, C. neoformans wild-type H99 and GAL7::IPC1               <br /> (#10) strains were grown on YPD for 48 h at 30&#194;&#176;C, washed three           <br /> times in PBS, and added to the J774.16 cells at a multiplicity of         <br /> infection (effector to target ratio of 1:1). After a short incubation       <br /> (30 min to 1 h), extracellular C. neoformans cells were washed          <br /> away with three changes in cell culture media. The imaging of              <br /> cells was performed with a Photometrics Sensys cooled CCD                 <br /> camera on an Olympus IX 70 microscope.
