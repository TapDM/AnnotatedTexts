Caenorhabditis elegans with a dss-1 <br />                  loss-of-function mutant and dss-1 directed RNAi. The analysis revealed an essential role for dss-1 <br />                  in oogenesis. In addition, dss-1 RNAi caused embryonic lethality and larval arrest, presumably due <br />                  to loss of the dss-1 mRNA maternal contribution. DSS-1::GFP fusion protein localised primarily in <br />                  the nucleus. No apparent effect on proteasome function was found in dss-1 RNAi treated worms. <br />                  However, expression of the C. elegans dss-1 in yeast cells deleted for its orthologue SEM1
