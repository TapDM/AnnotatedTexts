In this report we demonstrate that CdsL down-regulates CdsN enzymatic <br />                  activity in a dose-dependent manner. Using Pepscan epitope mapping we identified two separate <br />                          binding domains to which CdsL binds viz. CdsN221&#226;&#8364;&#8220;229 and CdsN265&#226;&#8364;&#8220;270. We confirmed the binding <br />                           domains using a pull-down assay and showed that GST&#226;&#8364;&#8220;CdsN221&#226;&#8364;&#8220;270, which encompasses these <br />  <br />                                             peptides, co-purified with His&#226;&#8364;&#8220;CdsL. Next, we used orthology modeling based on the crystal <br />  <br />             structure of a T3S ATPase ortholog <span id='am-1' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> Escherichia coli, EscN, to map the binding domains <br />          on the predicted 3D structure of CdsN. The CdsL binding domains mapped to the catalytic <br />                           domain of the ATPase, one in the central channel of the ATPase hexamer and one on the outer <br />  <br />                                             face. Since peptide mimetics have been used to disrupt essential protein interactions of the <br />                                             chlamydial T3S system and inhibit T3S-mediated invasion of HeLa cells, we hypothesized that <br />                                             if CdsL&#226;&#8364;&#8220;CdsN binding is essential for regulating T3S then a CdsN peptide mimetic could be <br />                                             used to potentially block T3S and chlamydial invasion. Treatment of elementary body with a <br />                                             CdsN peptide mimetic inhibited C. pneumoniae invasion into HeLa cells in a dose-dependent <br />                                             fashion.This report represents the first use of Pepscan technology to identify binding domains for <br />                                             specific T3S proteins viz. CdsL on the ATPase, CdsN, and demonstrates that peptide mimetics <br />                                             can be used as anti-virulence factors to block bacterial invasion. <br />                                             Keywords: type III secretion, peptide mimetic, Chlamydia, ATPase, Pepscan <br />  <br /> IntroductIon                                                                         close association with the inclusion membrane, suggesting a need <br /> Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate, intracellular Gram-negative                     for active T3S in RBs.
