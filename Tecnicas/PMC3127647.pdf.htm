The process is enhanced by ITSN binding of WASP, an effector of Cdc42 and a potent activator of actin <br />           polymerization. In the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, endocytic protein Cin1 also interacts with <br />           Cdc42 and Wsp1, an uncharacterized WASP homolog, but the significance of these interactions remains <br />           unknown. Wsp1 contains several conserved domains, including a WASP homology 1 domain (WH1), a GTPase <br />           binding/Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding domain (GBD/CRIB), and a C-terminal domain composed of <br />           verprolin-like, central, and acidic motifs (VCA). Thus, Wsp1 exhibits domain compositions more similar <span id='am-5' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> <br />           human WASP proteins than Saccharomyces cerevisiae Las17/Bee1, a WASP homolog lacking the GDB/CRIB <br />           domain. Wsp1 is not an essential protein; however, the wsp1 mutant exhibited defects in growth, cytokinesis, <br />           chitin distribution, and endocytosis and exocytosis. The wsp1 mutant was also unable to undergo genetic cross, <br />           produce the polysaccharide capsule, or secrete the enzyme urease. An in vitro phagocytosis assay showed a <br />           higher phagocytic index for the wsp1 mutant, whose ability to cause lethal infection in a murine model of <br />           cryptococcosis was also attenuated. Our studies reveal divergent evolution of WASP proteins in the fungal <br />           phylum and suggest that the conserved function of WASP proteins in the actin cytoskeleton may also impact <br />           fungal virulence. <br />  <br />  <br />    Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycetous fungal patho-                 main, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) proteins (WASP) are <br /> gen that infects primarily immunocompromised individuals,                     most known for their ability to promote actin assembly (4). <br /> causing meningoencephalitis, which is often fatal if left un-                    WASP and similar but neuron-specific WASP (N-WASP) <br /> treated (3, 19).
