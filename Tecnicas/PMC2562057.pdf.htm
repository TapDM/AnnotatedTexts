In 70% of patches, addition of 20 ,M NA + 1 ,M DPDPE <br /> delayed markedly the first channel openings, causing a four- to fivefold increase of the first latency at +20 mV. The two <br /> agonists or NA alone decreased also by 35% the open probability (po), prolonged partially the mean closed time, and <br /> increased the number of null sweeps. In contrast, NA + DPDPE had little action on the single-channel conductance (19 versus <br /> 19.2 pS) and minor effects on the mean open time. Similarly to macroscopic Ba2+ currents, the ensemble currents were fast <br /> activating at control but slowly activating and depressed with the two agonists. Inhibition of single N-type channels was <br /> effectively removed (facilitated) by short and large depolarizations. Facilitatory pre-pulses increased po significantly and <br /> decreased fourfold the first latency. Ensemble currents were small and slowly activating before pre-pulses and became <br /> threefold larger and fast decaying after facilitation. Our data suggest that slowdown of Ca2&apos; channel activation by transmitters <br /> is mostly due to delayed transitions <span id='am-2' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> a modified to a normal (facilitated) gating mode. This single-channel gating <br /> modulation could be well simulated by a Monte Carlo method using previously proposed kinetic models predicting marked <br /> prolongation of first channel openings. <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION <br /> Neuronal N-type Ca2+ channels can be effectively modu-                    inside the pore and responsible for Ca2+ ion permeation <br /> lated by neurotransmitters and peptides through the activa-               (Kuo and Bean, 1993).

In A1 the current traces were recorded at + 10 mV before (C) <br /> and during (NA) NA application and after washing (R) from -90 mV holding potential. In A2 the control trace (C) was recorded before application of the <br /> b-agonist (DPDPE). Addition of the nonspecific opioid antagonist naloxone prevented the action of DPDPE (nalo + DPDPE). (A3, A4) I/V curves recorded <br /> in response to ramp commands with a slope of 0.55 mV/ms from -90 mV holding potential, before (C) and during application of NA (10 j&#194;&#177;M) or DPDPE <br /> (1 j.AM) in 10 mM Ba2 . In A3 the resulting I/V relationships show an early peak at around-25 mV (LVA, arrow) that is unaffected by NA and a second <br /> peak at about +4 mV (HVA) that is largely depressed by the transmitter. In A4 the LVA current (arrow) is less evident, whereas the HVA component peaks <br /> at -9 mV, i.e., at slightly more negative potentials than in A3.
