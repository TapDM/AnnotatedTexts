The mutant cells are <br />              temperature-sensitive and accumulate large deposits of material that stain with calcofluor and aniline blue <br />              in their periplasmic space. Biochemical analyses of this material indicate that it consists of &#226;&#65533;&#163;- and &#226;&#65533;&#164;-glucans <br />              in the same ratio as found in cell walls of wild-type S. pombe. Strikingly, the glucan deposits in css1 mutant <br />              cells do not affect their overall morphology. The cells remain rod shaped, and the thickness of their walls <br />              is unaltered. Css1p is an essential protein related <span id='am-10' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> mammalian neutral sphingomyelinase and is responsible <br />              for the inositolphosphosphingolipid-phospholipase C activity observed in S. pombe membranes. Further- <br />              more, expression of css1&#226;&#171;&#185; can compensate for loss of ISC1, the enzyme responsible for this activity in <br />              Saccharomyces cerevisiae membranes. Css1p localizes to the entire plasma membrane and secretory pathway; <br />              a C-terminal fragment of Css1p, predicted to encode a single membrane-spanning segment, is sufficient <br />              to direct membrane localization of the heterologous protein, GFP. Our results predict the existence of <br />              an enzyme(s) or process(es) essential for the coordination of S. pombe cell wall formation and division <br />              that is, in turn, regulated by a sphingolipid metabolite. <br />  <br />  <br />                                                                           tomannans; alkali-soluble &#226;&#65533;&#163;-(1,3)-, &#226;&#65533;&#164;-(1,6)-, and &#226;&#65533;&#164;-(1,3)- <br /> S    CHIZOSACCHAROMYCES pombe cells, like other <br />      yeast, are surrounded by a rigid cell wall that pro- <br /> vides mechanical strength and protection <span id='am-6' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> environ- <br />                                                                           linked glucans; and an alkali-insoluble &#226;&#65533;&#164;-(1,3)-linked <br />                                                                           glucan with the &#226;&#65533;&#164;-(1,3)-linked glucans forming the ma- <br /> mental stresses (Cabib et al. 1997).
