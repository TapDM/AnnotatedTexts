If newly synthesized SecY is free from <br /> pKY225 (vector) (C1), AK520 (zgj-520::ISlA)/pKY318 (-), and                SecE, it will be recognized by FtsH and presented to prote- <br /> AK520/pKY225 (m) were grown at 37&#194;&#176;C in amino acid-supplemented             olysis.

(B) Cells of AK520/pKY225 (lanes 1-4), AK520/pKY318 <br /> (lanes 5-8), and AK519/pKY318 (lanes 9-12) were grown at 37&#194;&#176;C in           diately after the synthesis of the polypeptide chain.

Precursor   tions? The Std phenotype suggests that FtsH is somehow <br /> (p) and mature (m) forms of MBP and Bla were immunoprecipitated.           involved in correct assembly or integration of a SecY-PhoA <br />  <br /> fusion protein (16, 17). We believe that the Std phenotype is               <br /> not a simple consequence of stabilization of the fusion protein.               <br /> (i) The SecY-PhoA protein is much more stable than SecY                      <br /> itself. (ii) The ftsHl01-mediated export of PhoA domain that                    <br /> takes place only during the initial 10-20 min does not correlate                 <br />  <br /> quantitatively with the amounts of the fusion protein accumu-                   <br /> lated. (iii) SecE co-overproduction stabilizes the fusion protein               <br /> but does not cause increased PhoA translocation (Y.A., un-                  <br /> published results). (iv) Overproduction of a putative chaper-                <br /> one, HtpG, suppresses the Std phenotype, but it does not                           <br /> destabilize SecY or SecY-PhoA (Y. Shirai, unpublished re-                    <br /> sults). One possible explanation for the Std phenotype may be                       <br /> that FtsH facilitates (in the presence of SecE) assembly/                  <br /> integration of some segments of SecY into the lipid phase of                        <br /> the membrane (16, 17), although more indirect involvement                          <br /> such as degradation of some as yet unidentified protein that               <br /> antagonizes the stop transfer reaction cannot be excluded.                  <br />    The present work shows that excess SecY is inhibitory to                       <br /> protein export. However, some other alleles of ftsH, an ATP-                 <br /> binding site mutation and the chromosomal disruption offtsH,                <br /> cause defects of protein export without involving any overex-                     <br /> pression of secY (16, 17). Therefore, FtsH may be important                  <br /> not only for scavenging excess and free SecY molecules but                         <br /> also have a more active role (either direct or indirect) in <br />                                                                              <br /> protein export.                                                              <br />    Elucidation of the primary function of FtsH, like those of                      <br /> other AAA family members (15), awaits biochemical charac-                    <br /> terization of its wild-type and mutant forms. <br /> </body></html>
