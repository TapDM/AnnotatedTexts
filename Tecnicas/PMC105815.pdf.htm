These results lead us to conclude <br /> The data in Fig. 3A suggest that sordarin mostly bound to                               that the target is a soluble nonribosomal protein whose affinity <br /> crude ribosomes from C. albicans, which appears to contradict                           toward sordarin is markedly increased in the presence of ribo- <br /> previous results that suggested the nonribosomal nature of the                          somes, probably due to conformational arrangements in the <br /> sordarin target (6). To explain this, the following three hypoth-                       target when it is interacting with the ribosome. From this con- <br /> eses can be proposed: (i) The target is a ribosomal component.                          clusion good agreement between binding ability and resis- <br /> Previous results could be explained by assuming that resistant                          tance-sensitivity profiles can be stated, and therefore, binding <br /> species contain a nonribosomal protein capable of replacing                             to [3H]sordarin can be used to detect the sordarin target when <br /> target function when this is inhibited.

Although this could be valid for genetically modified <br /> strains, it is unlikely to account for the situation in naturally <br /> occurring resistant species such as C. parapsilosis. On the other <br /> hand, the third hypothesis is in good agreement with the results <br /> presented in Fig. 3A, which indicate that KCl-washed ribo- <br /> somes (devoid of any soluble factors) (32) have lost their ability <br /> to bind to sordarin, while the addition of PRS partially restores <br /> this ability. Moreover, ribosomes from sordarin-resistant spe- <br /> cies such as C. parapsilosis were unable to bind to [3H]sordarin, <br /> but when they were mixed with PRSs of sensitive species (C. al- <br /> bicans), binding of [3H]sordarin was considerably enhanced <br /> (Fig. 3B). Also, the inability of the ribosomes to bind to [3H] <br /> sordarin in the absence of soluble factors negates the second <br />                                                                                            FIG. 2.

Minor contami- <br /> nants coeluting with it seem to be derived from EF-2 pro- <br /> teolysis. <br />  <br />                               DISCUSSION <br />    The extremely high degree of selectivity of sordarins, a fact <br /> that favors their use as antifungal drugs, is a surprising event in <br /> light of its cellular target, one of the elongation factors in- <br /> volved in protein synthesis (6), because these factors are very <br /> well conserved proteins within the eukaryotic kingdom (16). So <br /> far, EF-3 is the only elongation factor reported to be present in <br /> yeasts but not in mammals (2, 31), and thus, it is commonly <br /> accepted as a suitable target for potential antifungal agents. <br /> Nevertheless, the selectivity can also come from subtle struc- <br /> tural differences between other more conserved components of <br /> the protein synthesis machinery, differences that might be mag- <br /> nified by the complex interactions which are displayed within <br /> the elongation cycle (5, 17). <br />    Purification of the sordarin-binding protein from C. albicans <br /> PRS has led to the identification of EF-2 as the target of this <br /> new series of antifungal agents. All major bands present on <br /> SDS-PAGE were ADP ribosylated by diphtheria toxin, and <br /> their sequences showed homology with EF-2 from S. cerevisiae <br /> (22). The presence of bands with molecular weights lower than <br /> that of EF-2 is due to proteolysis of the factor, a fact that has <br /> been linked to the regulation of protein synthesis (7&#226;&#8364;&#8220;9). More- <br /> over, the existence of a specific protease for EF-2 has been                            FIG. 4. Purification of sordarin target from C. albicans PRS.

Neverthe- <br /> less, differences in single key residues at EF-2 itself may also                                             <br /> account for the selectivity that has been found. The possibility                      <br /> of the sordarin interaction at the interface of the ribosome and                   <br /> the soluble factor can be ruled out because the PRS itself is                       <br /> able to bind to sordarin.                                                           <br />    EF-2, as well as its prokaryotic counterpart, EF-G, promotes                      <br /> translocation, i.e., displacement of nascent peptidyl-tRNA from                     <br />                                                                                      <br /> the A site to the P site and movement of the ribosome along <br />                                                                                      <br /> the mRNA; all of this is accompanied by a conformational <br /> change in the ribosome from the pretranslocational to the                                                              <br /> posttranslocational state (18). According to recent findings                    <br /> (27), GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by the elongation factor might                           <br /> provide the energy needed for the process. EF-2 is a highly                           <br />                                                                                        <br /> conserved protein (85% homology and 66% identity between                                <br /> human EF-2 and S. cerevisiae EF-2) (22). It has been shown                           <br /> both for EF-G and for EF-2 from different sources that this                             <br /> protein is able to display different conformations depending on                         <br />                                                                                      <br /> whether it is alone or interacting with GTP, GDP, or a ribo-                            <br /> some in either the pre- or the posttranslocational state (19, 20).                       <br /> This conformational flexibility provides its biological proper-                      <br /> ties and may be the reason that explains how such a conserved                            <br />                                                                                      <br /> protein can be the primary target of such very selective                               <br /> antifungal drugs as sordarins.
