We screened this resource in vivo for proliferation in murine lung tissue and in <br />                                 vitro for three well-recognized virulence attributes &#226;&#8364;&#8221; polysaccharide capsule formation, <br />                                 melanization, and growth at body temperature. We identified dozens of previously uncharacterized <br />                                 genes that affect these known attributes as well as 40 infectivity mutants without obvious defects in <br />                                 these traits. The latter mutants affect predicted regulatory factors, secreted proteins, and immune- <br />                                 related factors, and represent powerful tools for elucidating novel virulence mechanisms. In <br />                                 particular, we describe a GATA family transcription factor that inhibits phagocytosis by murine <br />                                 macrophages independently of the capsule, indicating a previously unknown mechanism of innate <br />                                 immune modulation. <br />  <br />  <br />                            INTRODUCTION <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                               Systematic profiling of gene deletion strain collections has been essential for the <br />                                               comprehensive study of biological processes in the nonpathogenic yeast Saccharomyces <br />                                               cerevisiae (Bader et al., 2003). Likewise, forward genetic screens of large mutant collections <br />                                               of bacterial pathogens have been extremely fruitful in identifying virulence pathways in <br />                                               prokaryotic organisms (Saenz and Dehio, 2005). In contrast, the study of fungal pathogenesis <br />                                               has historically been hindered by a relative lack of genetic tools and techniques in these <br />                                               eukaryotic species. With the release of complete genome sequences for numerous fungal <br />                                               pathogens (Jones et al., 2004; Loftus et al., 2005; Nierman et al., 2005), there are now <br />                                               unprecedented opportunities to create genome-scale resources and to apply systematic methods <br />                                               to the study of fungal virulence. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                            4 Correspondence, hiten@biochem.ucsf.edu tel (415) 514-0594, fax (415) 502-4315. <br />                            Publisher&apos;s Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

Whereas primary pulmonary infections are <br />                                            typically mildly symptomatic and self-resolving in patients with intact immune systems, these <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            infections commonly disseminate through the bloodstream to infect the meninges in HIV- <br />                                            positive patients. In sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, where over 80% of the world&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s <br />                                            HIV-infected population lives, studies indicate that 10&#226;&#8364;&#8220;40% of HIV-related deaths are caused <br />                                            by cryptococcal meningitis (Corbett et al., 2002; French et al., 2002). The high cost and limited <br />                                            availability of antifungal drugs often prohibit effective medical treatment in these areas <br />                                            (Warnock, 2006) and mortality rates in parts of sub-Saharan African approach 100% (Bekondi <br />                                            et al., 2006). <br />  <br />                                            There are three well-established mediators of C. neoformans virulence: a polysaccharide <br />                                            capsule, cell wall-associated melanin, and the ability to grow at human body temperature. The <br />                                            capsule has been shown to have both anti-phagocytic and immunomodulatory properties (Del <br />                                            Poeta, 2004; Monari et al., 2006). Melanin is believed to protect the fungus <span id='am-1' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> a broad range <br />                                            of toxic insults, both in the environment and the host (Nosanchuk and Casadevall, 2003). <br />  <br />                                            Molecular studies of C. neoformans virulence pathways have focused almost exclusively on <br />                                            the regulation of capsule and melanization (Table S1). Attempts to identify novel virulence <br />                                            mechanisms using random insertional mutagenesis have been hampered by biases in the <br />                                            insertion sites, chromosomal rearrangements, and relatively low ORF hit rates (Idnurm et al., <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            2004;Nelson et al., 2001). The release of the complete C. neoformans genome sequence now <br />                                            makes it possible to use directed <span id='am-316' about='Thesaurus:TESSE01'

         mechanisms. To this end, we constructed a large library of 1,201 signature-tagged, targeted <br />                                            gene deletion strains. Below, we describe insights gained from systematic profiling of this <br />                                            library in a murine infection model and in three in vitro assays for virulence-associated <br />                                            attributes (Figure 1). We also describe detailed analysis of a key transcriptional regulator that <br />                                            has pointed to the existence of an unsuspected capsule-independent mechanism for inhibition <br />                                            of phagocytosis. <br />  <br />                                RESULTS <br />                                Generation of signature-tagged C. neoformans gene deletion collection <br />                                            Approximately 1,500 genes in C. neoformans were targeted for deletion by homologous <br />                                            recombination. The majority (~900) were selected because of the absence of obvious homologs <br />                                            in the nonpathogenic fungus S. cerevisiae. The remainder encode proteins with sequence motifs <br />                                            implicating them in a broad variety of cellular processes. Because these targets were chosen <br />                                            prior to the availability of detailed gene models and were based on BLAST-based annotations <br />                                            (Chow et al., 2007), there was a bias against genes that are C. neoformans-specific. We utilized <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            fusion PCR to create deletion constructs in a high-throughput manner and optimized biolistic <br />                                            transformation for efficient recombination. For reasons described below, each mutant strain <br />                                            contains one of 48 unique signature tag DNA sequences adjacent to the deletion marker. The <br />                                            resulting set of 1,201 verified mutants represents deletions of 1,180 genes (in some cases, <br />                                            different domains of the same gene were targeted separately). For comparison, the genome of <br />                                            C. neoformans is predicted to contain ~6,500 genes (Loftus et al., 2005), and ~190 targeted <br />                                            gene deletions in C. neoformans have previously been reported in the literature (Table S1). <br />                                            The deletion collection is currently available without restriction through the Fungal Genetic <br />                                            Stock Center (www.fgsc.org) or ATCC (www.atcc.org). <br />  <br />                                Quantitative screen for infectivity mutants in a murine inhalation model of disease <br />                                            To identify C. neoformans genes involved in infectivity, we adopted signature-tagged <br />                                            mutagenesis (STM), a strategy that enables high-throughput, parallel analysis of pathogen <br />  <br />  <br />                                                    Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 October 3. <br />                             Liu et al.                                                                                                     Page 3 <br />  <br />  <br />                                            mutants in experimental infections (Saenz and Dehio, 2005). In this method, individual mutants <br />                                            are marked in their genomes with a unique DNA sequence (termed a signature tag or a barcode). <br />                                            This allows a pool of many mutants to be tested in a single animal infection by comparing the <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            relative representation of each mutant in the pool before and after selection in the host. In <br />                                            practice, this is accomplished by isolating DNA from mutant pathogen pools before and after <br />                                            infection and quantifying the abundance of each tag in the sample. <br />  <br />                                            We developed a robust, quantitative STM assay utilizing a previously established mouse model <br />                                            of pulmonary cryptococcal infection (Cox et al., 2000). C. neoformans deletion mutants were <br />                                            grown independently and then pooled into groups of 48 for intranasal infection of mice. <br />                                            Infections were allowed to progress until the mice displayed signs of significant morbidity <br />                                            (~5&#226;&#8364;&#8220;6 weeks), at which time the mice were sacrificed and C. neoformans cells were recovered <br />                                            from the lung tissue. Quantitative PCR using tag-specific primers together with a common <br />                                            primer in the gene deletion cassette was used to measure the relative abundance of each mutant <br />                                            in both the input and recovered pools. The ratio of these two values ([recovered] / [input]) was <br />                                            calculated on a log2 scale and termed the STM score (see Experimental Procedures). As shown <br />                                            in Figure 2A, STM scores demonstrated remarkable consistency among the three mice infected <br />                                            with each pool of signature-tagged mutants. In total, 1,100 deletion mutants were screened <br />                                            using the STM assay. <br />  <br />                                            We next determined if the STM score for a given mutant was affected by the composition of <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            mutants in that pool. 104 mutants were removed from their original pools and sorted into new <br />                                            pools containing different mutants. Infections were repeated and STM scores were recalculated <br />                                            for each mutant. The original STM scores were highly correlated with the re-pooled STM <br />                                            scores (R2=0.84), demonstrating that the STM scores were largely independent of the identities <br />                                            of the competing mutants and were highly reproducible from pool to pool (Figure 2B). <br />  <br />                                            As an additional control for reproducibility of the assay, we constructed 43 independent <br />                                            disruptions of the gene SXI1, which is required for mating but dispensable for virulence (Hull <br />                                            et al., 2004); each mutant was marked with a different signature tag. The 43 sxi1&#206;&#8221; mutant <br />                                            strains were tested a total of 293 times throughout the STM screen and, as expected, the <br />                                            distribution of STM scores for the sxi1&#206;&#8221; strains was centered near zero (median=0.1) and <br />                                            showed a tight range (SD=0.5) (Figure 2C). The distribution of STM scores for the deletion <br />                                            library as a whole was also centered on zero (median=0.0); however, in this case, the <br />                                            distribution of scores was much broader (SD=3.3), suggesting a wide range of fitness in the <br />                                            assay. <br />  <br />                                STM phenotypes correlate with virulence <br />                                            STM screens are designed to measure the relative competitive fitness of mutants in a mixed <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            infection. Thus, the term &#226;&#8364;&#339;infectivity&#226;&#8364;&#65533; in this context refers to this ability to proliferate/survive <br />                                            within host tissue. &#226;&#8364;&#339;Virulence,&#226;&#8364;&#65533; on the other hand, is classically defined as the ability of an <br />                                            individual strain not only to proliferate, but to cause disease as well. To assess the ability of <br />                                            our STM screen phenotypes to predict virulence defects, we performed two additional tests. <br />  <br />                                            First, we asked whether previously identified virulence mutants included in our deletion <br />                                            collection were detected by the screen. Among 24 previously-reported virulence mutants, 21 <br />                                            displayed STM scores significantly below zero, ranging from &#226;&#710;&#8217;12.8 to &#226;&#710;&#8217;1.9 (labeled on the x- <br />                                            axis of Figure 2C and Table S2). Two published virulence mutants, lac1&#206;&#8221; and ure1&#206;&#8221;, had <br />                                            normal STM scores. These mutants, however, are known to replicate normally in mouse lungs <br />                                            and have late defects in dissemination (Noverr et al., 2004; Olszewski et al., 2004); such <br />                                            mutants would not be anticipated to have defects in our screen. The final virulence mutant, <br />                                            scp1&#206;&#8221;, was retested in our assay using a different pool of mutants, and a significantly lower <br />                                            STM score was detected (&#226;&#710;&#8217;3.6 vs. &#226;&#710;&#8217;0.8). These results demonstrate a robust sensitivity of the <br />  <br />  <br />                                                     Cell.

In these experiments, <br />                                            virulence was directly measured by determining the rate at which mice infected with a single <br />                                            strain of C. neoformans reach a defined disease endpoint (see Supplementary Materials). <br />                                            Monotypic intranasal infections of 8&#226;&#8364;&#8220;10 mice per mutant and a wild-type control were <br />                                            performed and the time to significant morbidity was assessed for each mouse. Survival curves <br />                                            were plotted for the mutant strains and compared to that of the wild-type control. Two mutants <br />                                            with STM scores close to zero were indistinguishable from wild-type in these survival curves <br />                                            (Figure 2D). Four mutants with STM scores significantly below zero were attenuated for <br />                                            virulence (Figure 2E) with the degree of attenuation closely correlated with the magnitude of <br />                                            the STM defect. Interestingly, a mutant with an STM score significantly above zero <br />                                            (zap103&#206;&#8221;) was hypervirulent (Figure 2E). Together, these studies suggest that the STM assay <br />                                            is a sensitive and specific measure for infectivity and that in this pulmonary infection model <br />                                            of cryptococcosis, altered infectivity correlates well with altered virulence. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            Based on these results, we chose STM scores of &lt; &#226;&#710;&#8217;2.5 and &gt; +2.5 as the cutoff points for <br />                                            reduced infectivity and increased infectivity, respectively. Application of these criteria to our <br />                                            data yielded 164 (15%) mutants in the former category and 33 (3%) in the latter. <br />  <br />                                Systematic in vitro phenotyping of the deletion collection identifies mutants defective in <br />                                known virulence attributes <br />                                            To complement the in vivo STM screen, we systematically assayed the deletion collection in <br />                                            vitro for three known virulence-associated phenotypes: 1) growth in minimal medium at 37&#194;&#176; <br />                                            C, 2) melanization, and 3) synthesis of the polysaccharide capsule. <br />  <br />                                            A high-throughput, 96-well format assay was developed to measure the growth of each mutant <br />                                            in synthetic minimal medium (YNB) at 37&#194;&#176;C. As expected, a large overlap existed between <br />                                            mutants that displayed poor growth at 37&#194;&#176;C and mutants with STM defects (P=8.2E-30) (Figure <br />                                            2F). Using hypergeometric distribution analysis, we determined that mutants that displayed <br />                                            growth scores greater than &#226;&#710;&#8217;0.5 did not show a significant enrichment for mutants with <br />                                            virulence phenotypes (P &gt; 0.01) (Figure S1); thus, we used a growth score of &#226;&#710;&#8217;0.5 as a cutoff <br />                                            for determining which mutants were categorized as having significant growth defects. Some <br />                                            mutants displayed severe growth defects but not STM defects. We attributed at least a portion <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            of this inconsistency to the fact that minimal medium does not perfectly mimic the nutritional <br />                                            environment found within the host. For example, mutants in peroxisome function (pex1&#206;&#8221; and <br />                                            pex6&#206;&#8221;) have been shown previously to have normal virulence despite being unable to grow on <br />                                            YNB with glucose as the sole carbon source (Idnurm et al., 2007). <br />  <br />                                            To identify mutants defective in melanin synthesis, we grew the deletion collection on agar <br />                                            plates containing L-DOPA (a diphenolic substrate). Wild-type cells turned dark brown over <br />                                            2&#226;&#8364;&#8220;3 days as they synthesized and accumulated melanin. Thirty-eight deletion mutants <br />                                            displayed decreased levels of melanization compared to wild-type, including known melanin <br />                                            mutants such as lac1&#206;&#8221;, cac1&#206;&#8221;, and pka1&#206;&#8221;.(Alspaugh et al., 2002; D&apos;Souza et al., 2001; Noverr <br />                                            et al., 2004). As noted above, the lac1&#206;&#8221; mutant (which lacks the laccase primarily responsible <br />                                            for melanin synthesis) has late defects in dissemination from the lungs but grows normally in <br />                                            lung tissue (Noverr et al., 2004); as such, it was not identified by the STM screen. Likewise, <br />                                            a mutant containing a deletion of the second C. neoformans laccase gene, LAC2, as well as a <br />  <br />  <br />                                                    Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 October 3. <br />                             Liu et al.                                                                                               Page 5 <br />  <br />  <br />                                           double knockout mutant, lac1&#206;&#8221; lac2&#206;&#8221;, did not display STM phenotypes (Table S2). This is <br />                                           consistent with melanization playing a role in dissemination, but not lung infectivity. Thus, we <br />                                           were surprised to note that overall there was a significant overlap between mutants with <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           melanization defects and those with STM defects in the lungs (Figure 2F). This association <br />                                           remained significant (P =1.4E-11) even after excluding mutants with growth defects from the <br />                                           analysis. Given that the laccases were dispensable for lung infection, additional defects beyond <br />                                           poor pigment production must be proposed in this subset of melanin-defective mutants to <br />                                           account for their lung infectivity defects. These deficits may affect co-regulated pathways that <br />                                           function independently of and/or redundantly with melanization to promote lung proliferation. <br />  <br />                                           To identify mutants defective in polysaccharide capsule formation, we screened for mutants <br />                                           with a dry colony appearance on rich medium (YPAD) agar plates. A dry colony morphology <br />                                           is characteristic of most known C. neoformans mutants with absent or greatly reduced amounts <br />                                           of capsule (Griffith et al., 2004; Moyrand et al., 2004; Moyrand and Janbon, 2004). Using this <br />                                           simple assay, we identified eleven potentially capsule-defective mutants including six strains <br />                                           (cap59&#206;&#8221;, cap64&#206;&#8221;, cap60&#206;&#8221;, cap10&#206;&#8221;, cas35&#206;&#8221;, and nrg1&#206;&#8221;) that contain deletions in genes <br />                                           previously implicated in capsule synthesis (Cramer et al., 2006; Moyrand et al., 2004; <br />                                           Okabayashi et al., 2007). In addition, PBX1 and PBX2 were first identified in this screen; <br />                                           deletion of PBX1 or PBX2 affects the fidelity of polysaccharide synthesis and their detailed <br />                                           analysis has been described elsewhere (Liu et al., 2007). As expected, all mutants with dry <br />                                           colony morphologies also had STM defects, consistent with the well-established importance <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           of the capsule for causing disease (Figure 2F). <br />  <br />                                           Certain mutants, such as pka1&#206;&#8221; and cac1&#206;&#8221;, are known to produce reduced or structurally- <br />                                           altered capsules (Alspaugh et al., 2002; D&apos;Souza et al., 2001), but do not have dry colony <br />                                           morphologies. To identify this class of mutant, we tested a subset of mutants in the collection <br />                                           for the ability to induce capsule formation using an India ink assay. This stain yields a <br />                                           characteristic halo around cells with enlarged capsules (we note this analysis does not rule out <br />                                           subtle capsule structure defects that would otherwise only be detectable by NMR analysis). <br />                                           We tested 82 mutants that displayed melanin and/or STM defects but normal colony <br />                                           morphology. Only one mutant, containing a deletion of GAT201 (which encodes a GATA- <br />                                           family zinc finger DNA-binding transcriptional regulator, Figure S2), produced no visible <br />                                           capsule by India ink staining under capsule-inducing conditions (Figure 4C). Further <br />                                           investigation of the role of GAT201 in C. neoformans pathogenesis is described below. <br />  <br />                                           In total, among 164 mutants with STM defects, 85 also had defects in growth at 37&#194;&#176;C, <br />                                           polysaccharide capsule formation, and/or melanization. The remaining 79 mutants appeared <br />                                           normal in all three in vitro assays (Figure 2F). To verify that the observed phenotypes were <br />                                           linked to the targeted deletions, we reconstructed 107 deletion strains and retested for the <br /> NIH-PA

Slightly higher variability in reproduction of STM phenotypes may reflect both <br />                                           higher variability of the assay and the potential for a larger number of unlinked mutations to <br />                                           affect this phenotype. <br />  <br />                                Novel melanin and capsule genes <br />                                           Thirty-three novel genes that regulate melanization and five novel genes that regulate capsule <br />                                           formation were identified and verified by knockout reconstruction and retesting (Figure 3, <br />                                           Table 1). As described previously (Chow et al., 2007), gene names were assigned based on <br />                                           homology to known S. cerevisiae genes when available. Four melanin genes and one capsule <br />                                           gene could not be named using this approach and, instead, were designated MLN1&#226;&#8364;&#8220;MLN4 and <br />  <br />                                                   Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 October 3. <br />                             Liu et al.

The melanin and capsule genes identified in these screens implicate a <br />                                            number of novel pathways in the regulation of these two virulence attributes. For example, <br />                                            mutants that lack the transcription factor Rim101 and its predicted upstream regulator Rim20 <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            both display melanization defects (Figure S3). Similarly, deletion of components of the Set3 <br />                                            deacetylase complex resulted in significantly larger capsules compared to wild-type as well as <br />                                            defects in melanization (Figure S3&#226;&#8364;&#8220;S4). <br />  <br />                                Novel infectivity genes <br />                                            A particularly interesting category of mutants identified in these screens had defects in lung <br />                                            infectivity but were normal for growth, capsule, and melanin. Forty of these mutants were <br />                                            verified by knockout reconstruction and retesting using the STM assay (Figure 3, Table 2). <br />                                            Again, gene names were assigned based on homology to known S. cerevisiae genes when <br />                                            available. Fifteen unnamed genes were designated LIV1&#226;&#8364;&#8220;LIV15 (Lung InfectiVity). <br />  <br />                                            In addition to capsule, melanin, and growth, a number of other less-studied factors have been <br />                                            implicated in C. neoformans virulence based on genetic studies. These include urease, <br />                                            alternative oxidase, phospholipase, reductive iron uptake, glucosylceramide synthesis, and <br />                                            resistance to nitrogen and oxygen species (Akhter et al., 2003; Cox et al., 2003; Cox et al., <br />                                            2001; Cox et al., 2000; de Jesus-Berrios et al., 2003; Jung et al., 2008; Shea et al., 2006). In <br />                                            most cases, mutants in these pathways display growth defects on certain media. For example, <br />                                            mutants lacking the phospholipase gene (PLB1) are sensitive to SDS (Siafakas et al., 2007), <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            mutants lacking the flavohemoglobin gene (FHB1) are sensitive to acidified nitrite, and <br />                                            mutants lacking the alternative oxidase gene (AOX1) are sensitive to potassium cyanide (KCN). <br />                                            Thus, in order to identify potential roles for these infectivity genes, we systematically tested <br />                                            the 40 mutants described above for growth on five media conditions as well as for urease <br />                                            activity using an enzymatic assay. This analysis revealed five mutants with sensitivity to <br />                                            acidified nitrite, two with sensitivity to SDS, and two with sensitivity to KCN (Table 2, Figure <br />                                            S5&#226;&#8364;&#8220;S7). In contrast, none of the mutants displayed decreased growth in pH 4 media (Figure <br />                                            S5) or in low ferrous iron conditions (Figure S8) and none of the mutants displayed a defect <br />                                            in urease activity (Figures S9). <br />  <br />                                            Two of the mutants that displayed increased sensitivity to acidified nitrite contain deletions of <br />                                            DNA repair genes (rad54&#206;&#8221; and rad23&#206;&#8221;), suggesting that unrepaired DNA damage, perhaps <br />                                            via free radical attack by phagocytes, can be deleterious to infection (Figure S5). Notably, a <br />                                            mutant containing a deletion of LIV8, which encodes an RGS (Regulator of G-protein <br />                                            Signaling) domain, was exquisitely sensitive to acidified nitrite, SDS, and KCN (Figures S5&#226;&#8364;&#8220; <br />                                            S7). We note that since these media assays are relatively nonspecific, the sensitivities observed <br />                                            may or may not explain the virulence defects of particular mutants. For example, a mutant <br />                                            containing a deletion of the virulence gene SRE1, which has been shown to be involved in <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            ergosterol biosynthesis (Chang et al., 2007; Chun et al., 2007), displayed sensitivity to both <br />                                            SDS and KCN (Figures S6&#226;&#8364;&#8220;S7). <br />  <br />                                            Nonetheless, the 33 mutants that did not display phenotypes in any of these in vitro assays <br />                                            represent the genes that are the strongest candidates for novel C. neoformans virulence factors. <br />                                            Seven genes in this category encode predicted sequence-specific transcription factors. Another <br />                                            five genes encode factors likely involved in chromatin regulation. Of particular note, three <br />                                            genes encode factors with strong homology to proteins previously implicated in pathogenesis <br />                                            or regulation of the human immune response (Figure 3, Table 2). LIV5 encodes a protein <br />                                            homologous to one required for pathogenesis by the plant fungal pathogen Magnaporthe <br />                                            grisea (Fujimoto et al., 2002). LIV7 encodes a putative secreted protein that is homologous to <br />                                            a human protein induced by lipopolysaccharide. Finally, LIV6 encodes a protein highly <br />                                            homologous to the human T-cell immunomodulatory protein (TIP). Secreted TIP has been <br />                                            shown to directly regulate cytokine production by T-cells (Fiscella et al., 2003).

Page 7 <br />  <br />  <br />                                            structure prediction indicated that Liv6 contains FG-GAP repeats, which are commonly found <br />                                            in alpha integrins, as well as a signal peptide sequence, suggesting that it may be secreted <br />                                            (Figure S2). Deletion of LIV5 and LIV6 were confirmed to result in virulence defects by <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            survival curve analysis (Figure 2E, Figure S10). <br />  <br />                                            We also identified mutants that reproducibly showed significant increases in the STM assay. <br />                                            Eight mutants were confirmed by knockout reconstruction and retesting to display enhanced <br />                                            colonization of lung tissue (Table 2). These include deletions of genes encoding two members <br />                                            of Rho signaling pathways (RGD1 and RHO104), two kinases (RCK2 and KSP1), and a <br />                                            transcription factor (ZAP103). One unnamed gene was designated LIV16. Deletions of <br />                                            ZAP103 and RGD1 were confirmed to result in increased virulence by survival curve analysis <br />                                            (Figure 2E, Figure S10). <br />  <br />                                Gat201: a key regulator of virulence and capsule-independent anti-phagocytic mechanisms <br />                                            Among mutants with normal growth at 37&#194;&#176;C, the strain containing a deletion of GAT201 <br />                                            exhibited the largest decrease in the STM screen (STM score = &#226;&#710;&#8217;18.3). Indeed, the gat201&#206;&#8221; <br />                                            mutant strain was avirulent in monotypic infection of mice using our standard inoculum (Figure <br />                                            4A). This mutant was chosen for further investigation. <br />  <br />                                            As described above, capsules of gat201&#206;&#8221; cells could not be visualized by India ink staining <br />                                            under capsule-inducing conditions (Figure 4B). However, a more sensitive assay using a <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            monoclonal antibody to stain the main capsular polysaccharide, glucoronoxylomannan, <br />                                            detected capsule polysaccharide on the cell surface of gat201&#206;&#8221; cells (Figure 5B). These data <br />                                            suggest GAT201 is not required for production of basal levels of capsule polysaccharide but is <br />                                            needed for proper induction of large capsules. gat201&#206;&#8221; cells were also hypermelanized when <br />                                            grown on L-DOPA plates (Figure 4C). Previously-identified hypermelanized mutants have <br />                                            been associated with both increased and decreased virulence and often display additional <br />                                            phenotypes such as altered capsule production (Bahn et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2004). Similarly, <br />                                            our studies indicate GAT201 participates directly or indirectly in the regulation of both capsule <br />                                            induction and melanization. <br />  <br />                                            Consistent with this notion, overexpression of GAT201 in wild-type cells using the promoter <br />                                            of a constitutive ribosomal protein gene (pRPL2b) was sufficient to induce large capsule <br />                                            formation, even in normally non-inducing growth conditions (Figure 4B, Figure S11). As <br />                                            shown in Figure 4C, the pRPL2b::GAT201 strain also displayed a slight melanization defect. <br />                                            The pRPL2b::GAT201 strain was hypervirulent in mice after monotypic intranasal infection <br />                                            (Figure 4A), demonstrating that overexpression of GAT201 is sufficient to activate key <br />                                            virulence pathways. A reconstructed gat201&#206;&#8221; strain recapitulated the phenotypes of the original <br />                                            gat201&#206;&#8221; strain in these assays (Figure 4A&#226;&#8364;&#8220;4C). <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            Whole-genome, microarray-based expression profiling of the pRPL2b::GAT201 strain <br />                                            identified 543 genes that were significantly upregulated and 24 genes that were significantly <br />                                            downregulated compared to a wild-type strain (Figure 4D). Consistent with the enhanced <br />                                            nutritional and metabolic requirements necessary for ectopic polysaccharide capsule <br />                                            formation, the induced set contained a substantial number of genes encoding proteins involved <br />                                            in carbohydrate regulation, including sugar transporters (40 genes), glycosyl hydrolases (8 <br />                                            genes), and glycosyl transferases (5 genes). In addition, twenty-five genes that encode DNA- <br />                                            binding transcription factors were upregulated in the pRPL2b::GAT201 strain, suggesting that <br />                                            Gat201 exerts at least a portion of its effects by activating the expression of other transcription <br />                                            factors. Using a previously described annotation database (Chow et al., 2007), we identified <br />                                            C. neoformans genes that do not have homologs in nine sequenced ascomycetes and two <br />                                            sequenced basidiomycetes. Over 29% of Gat201-upregulated genes (159 genes) fall into this <br />                                            C. neoformans-specific gene class, which represents a significant enrichment over their general <br />  <br />  <br />                                                    Cell.

Sixteen of these genes are predicted to produce <br />                                         proteins with signal sequences but no transmembrane domain; these potential secreted effectors <br />                                         include all members of a unique four-gene family (CNF2230, CNF2240, CNF2250, and <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         CND5620). <br />  <br />                                         To further probe the role of Gat201 in virulence, we examined the interaction of gat201&#206;&#8221; cells <br />                                         with RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. Phagocytic cells play a central role in the host immune <br />                                         response against C. neoformans, and the ability of C. neoformans to avoid phagocytosis and <br />                                         killing by these cells is crucial to pathogenesis (Del Poeta, 2004). In contrast to most fungi, <br />                                         such as C. albicans and S. cerevisiae, wild-type C. neoformans undergoes negligible <br />                                         phagocytosis by cultured macrophages in the absence of opsonizing antibodies or complement <br />                                         (Kozel and Mastroianni, 1976). The anti-phagocytic properties of C. neoformans have largely <br />                                         been attributed to the polysaccharide capsule (Del Poeta, 2004). We recapitulated these results <br />                                         with wild-type C. neoformans, observing both robust induction of capsule and a very low rate <br />                                         of phagocytosis after 24 hours of co-culturing with RAW264.7 macrophages (&lt;2% of <br />                                         macrophages contained internalized wild-type C. neoformans, Figures 5A&#226;&#8364;&#8220;B, Figure S12). <br />                                         Deletion of the capsule-associated genes CAP10, CAP60, or CAP64 resulted in approximately <br />                                         a three- to seven-fold increase in the number of macrophages containing C. neoformans (4&#226;&#8364;&#8220; <br />                                         14%). As previously reported (Moyrand and Janbon, 2004), cap10&#206;&#8221;, cap60&#206;&#8221;, and cap64&#206;&#8221; <br />                                         mutants had no detectable capsular material, either by antibody or India ink staining (Figure <br />                                         5C). Unexpectedly, a dramatic increase in the amount of phagocytosis was seen when <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         RAW264.7 macrophages were co-cultured with gat201&#206;&#8221; cells; 66% of macrophages contained <br />                                         internalized C. neoformans after 24 hours (Figure 5A&#226;&#8364;&#8220;B). Since gat201&#206;&#8221; mutants were <br />                                         phagocytosed more readily than CAP gene mutants, yet displayed a weaker capsule defect, the <br />                                         phagocytosis phenotype of gat201&#206;&#8221; cells could not easily be explained by its hypocapsular <br />                                         phenotype. To examine the role of GAT201 in the absence of capsule, we asked whether double <br />                                         mutants lacking both GAT201 and one of the CAP genes were phagocytosed to a greater extent <br />                                         than the CAP gene single mutants. Strikingly, we found this to be the case: high levels of <br />                                         phagocytosis were seen in gat201&#206;&#8221; cap10&#206;&#8221; (47%), gat201&#206;&#8221; cap60&#206;&#8221; (57%), and gat201&#206;&#8221; <br />                                         cap64&#206;&#8221; (52%) double mutant strains (Figure 5B). Unlike gat201&#206;&#8221; single mutants, these double <br />                                         mutant strains had no detectable capsules by antibody or India ink staining and displayed <br />                                         clumpy phenotypes characteristic of cap10&#206;&#8221;, cap60&#206;&#8221;, and cap64&#206;&#8221; single mutants (Figure 5C), <br />                                         indicating that the capsule is not the basis for the difference in phagocytosis between <br />                                         gat201&#206;&#8221; and the CAP mutants. <br />  <br />                                DISCUSSION <br />                                         The incidence of invasive fungal infections in humans has risen dramatically in the last two <br />                                         decades (Warnock, 2006), yet our understanding of the molecular mechanisms relevant to <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                         fungal pathogenesis remains limited. The analysis of the C. neoformans gene deletion <br />                                         collection described here demonstrates the potential for harnessing genome sequencing efforts <br />                                         to implement systematic approaches for identifying and dissecting fungal virulence <br />                                         mechanisms. Since biolistic gene knockout methods for C. neoformans were introduced in <br />                                         1993, ~190 targeted deletions have been reported in the literature (Table S1 summarizes the <br />                                         phenotypes of previously-described gene deletions). We report the construction and analysis <br />                                         of 1,201 targeted gene deletion strains, significantly extending the genetic resources for this <br />                                         pathogen. Systematic profiling of the deletion collection yielded a number of insights into C. <br />                                         neoformans virulence: <br />                                             1.

Polysaccharide capsule: We confirmed the role of the polysaccharide capsule in <br />                                                     virulence. Our screen identified four novel hypocapsular mutants, all of which <br />                                                     displayed defects in infection.

Gat201 <br />                                                     is normally limiting for synthesis of this virulence factor since overexpression of <br />                                                     GAT201 is sufficient to induce capsule synthesis under classically non-inducing <br />                                                     conditions.

These pooled inocula were used to intranasally infect three mice <br />                                             each. Three aliquots of each inoculum (~5 &#195;&#8212; 105 cells) were also plated on Sabouraud agar <br />                                             plates containing 40 &#194;&#181;g/mL gentamicin and 50 &#194;&#181;g/mL carbenicillin.
