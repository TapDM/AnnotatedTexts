Next day, cells were washed twice with PBS <br /> 1999). Briefly, BMDMs were suspended in culture medium at            and 100 ml DMEM without phenol red containing 10% FCS. <br /> a density of 4 &#194;&#165; 105 cells ml-1 and kept warm at 37&#194;&#176;C in a           Overnight cultures of C. albicans cells were washed in PBS, <br /> water bath for a maximum of 30 min.

Aliquots of 50 ml cell suspensions were <br /> plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark); 50 ml HBSS medium con-              added to the first two columns, and serial fourfold dilutions of <br />  <br />                                               <br />  <br /> C. albicans suspensions were placed in subsequent columns.          <br /> Plates were spun at 500 g for 1 min, followed by incubation at      <br /> 37&#194;&#176;C and 5% CO2 for 48 h. Yeast colonies were stained in the           <br /> 96-well plate with Cristal violet, using a 0.2% solution in 20%     <br /> MeOH exactly as described previously (Stockinger et al.,              <br /> 2002). Viable colonies were counted and compared with                  <br /> equivalent dilutions in wells with macrophages. An assay              <br /> setup of four to eight plates per day was defined as one             <br /> experiment. At least three independent experiments were             <br /> performed per condition. Colonies from a total of at least 25         <br /> wells per condition were used to quantify viability data.              <br />                                                                                                                  <br /> </body></html>
