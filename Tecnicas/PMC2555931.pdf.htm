This paradigm has been <br /> extended to the intracellular compartments by studies in yeast showing that trafficking of G&#226;&#65533;&#163; activates phosphatidylino- <br /> sitol 3-kinase (PI3K) at endosomal compartments, suggesting that vesicle trafficking regulates potential actions of G&#226;&#65533;&#163; and <br /> possibly G&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#165; at the level of endosomes. Here, we show that G&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#165; interacts with Rab11a and that the two proteins <br /> colocalize at early and recycling endosomes in response to activation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors. This <br /> agonist-dependent association of G&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#165; to Rab11a-positive endosomes contributes to the recruitment of PI3K and phos- <br /> phorylation of AKT at this intracellular compartment. These events are sensitive to the expression of a dominant-negative <br /> Rab11a mutant or treatment with wortmannin, suggesting that Rab11a-dependent G&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#165; trafficking promotes the activation <br /> of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway associated with endosomal compartments.

(A) HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with dominant-negative GFP-Rab11a mutant <br /> (GFP-Rab11a S25N) were serum starved for 15 h followed by stimulation with 10 &#226;&#65533;&#174;M LPA for the indicated times. Cell lysates were obtained <br /> and early endosomal fraction was isolated by a flotation step gradient as described in Materials and Methods. The presence of the indicated <br /> proteins in the endosomal fraction was detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies. (B) Effect of different Rab11a constructs on <br /> LPA-dependent G&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#165; and downstream effectors association to endosomes. HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with GFP-Rab11a, <br /> GFP-Rab11a Q70L, or GFP-Rab11a S25N mutants, cells were processed as described, and the presence of the indicated proteins in the <br /> endosomal fraction was detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies.

The effect of LPA stimulation on the <br /> association of PI3-kinase-&#226;&#65533;&#165; and the presence and endosomal phosphorylation of AKT was also evaluated in the same fractions by using <br /> specific antibodies.

HEK-293T cells grown to 80% <br /> confluence were serum starved for 15 h followed by stimulation with 10 &#226;&#65533;&#174;M LPA for the indicated times or left unstimulated (NS). A group <br /> of cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml PTX for 20 h. The presence of the indicated proteins in the endosomal fraction was detected by <br /> Western blotting using specific antibodies. NS, nonstimulated cells. The effect of LPA stimulation and PTX treatment on association of <br /> PI3-kinase-&#226;&#65533;&#165; and the presence and endosomal phosphorylation of AKT were also evaluated in the same endosomal fractions by using specific <br /> antibodies. To assess the phosphorylation of AKT in samples with similar amounts of endosomal AKT, we diluted the samples obtained from <br /> LPA-stimulated cells (1:4 or 1:1.8, as indicated), and then we phosphorylated AKT and total AKT were detected by Western blot.

To assess the phosphorylation of AKT in <br /> samples with similar amounts of endosomal AKT, the sample obtained from control cells stimulated with 10 &#226;&#65533;&#174;M LPA was diluted as <br /> indicated, and then phosphorylated AKT and total AKT were detect Western blot. The expression of transfected G&#226;&#65533;&#163;i2 or PhLP1 in total lysates <br /> was demonstrated by Western blot. <br />  <br />  <br /> with &#226;&#65533;&#164;-arrestins (Ferguson, 2001; Luttrell and Lefkowitz,                      and promotes the trafficking of G&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#165; to endosomal compart- <br /> 2002; Tohgo et al., 2003; Ahn et al., 2004; Prossnitz, 2004;                   ments in which it is critical for the assembly and activation <br /> Johnson et al., 2005; Lefkowitz et al., 2006; Marrari et al., 2007;            of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway associated with <br /> Moore et al., 2007).

Model depicting the redistribution and endosomal signaling of G&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#165;.

The liberated G&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#165; heterodimer activates its effectors such as PI3-kinase-&#226;&#65533;&#165; at the plasma membrane, <br /> leading to the activation of AKT (1). G&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#165; also interacts with Rab11a, promoting G&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#165; trafficking to early and slowly recycling endosomes (as <br /> defined by the presence of Rab11a) (2). The assembly of a signaling complex occurs at endosomes after recruitment of PI3-kinase-&#226;&#65533;&#165; followed <br /> by activation of AKT (steps 3 and 4). A fraction of AKT is associated with this endosomal fraction even in nonstimulated cells, but the <br /> association of this protein is further increased in response to receptor stimulation leading to the phosphorylation of endosomal AKT (5). <br /> GSK-3-&#226;&#65533;&#164; is recruited in response to receptor stimulation (step 6). Inhibition of PI3-kinase by Wm prevents the association of PI3-kinase-&#226;&#65533;&#165; to <br /> endosomes and the phosphorylation of AKT. To complete the cycle, presumably G&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#165; is recycled to the plasma membrane to start a new cycle <br /> of signaling (7). <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> dosomes, we speculate that this fraction of AKT associates to               fraction of AKT independently of its activation state.

A fraction of AKT is located at the <br /> endosomal compartment of nonstimulated cells and is fur-                <br /> ther recruited after receptor stimulation (steps 4 and 5).
