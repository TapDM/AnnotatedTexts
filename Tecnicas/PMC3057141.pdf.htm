We examined the dynamic development of two arborized mechanoreceptor neurons <br />                                  (PVDs) required for reception of strong mechanical stimuli in Caenorhabditis elegans. The PVDs <br />                                  elaborated dendritic trees comprising structural units we call &#226;&#8364;&#339;menorahs.&#226;&#8364;&#65533; We studied how the <br />                                  number, structure, and function of menorahs were maintained. EFF-1, an essential protein <br />                                  mediating cell fusion, acted autonomously in the PVDs <span id='am-4' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> trim developing menorahs. eff-1 <br />                                  mutants displayed hyperbranched, disorganized menorahs. Overexpression of EFF-1 in the PVD <br />                                  reduced branching. Neuronal pruning appeared to involve EFF-1&#226;&#8364;&#8220;dependent branch retraction and <br />                                  neurite-neurite autofusion. Thus, EFF-1 activities may act as a quality control mechanism during <br />                                  the sculpting of dendritic trees. <br />  <br />                                              Morphologies of dendritic trees vary <span id='am-3' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> one neuronal type to another, and the <span id='am-83' about='xsp:pattern' typeof='owl:Thing'>pattern</span> of <br />                                              these arbors determines the manner in which a neuron processes its synaptic or sensory <br />                                              input. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms controlling the outgrowth and <br />                                              maintenance of dendritic trees (1&#226;&#8364;&#8220;4). Two mechano-receptors in Caenorhabditis elegans <br />                                              (PVDR and PVDL; right and left, respectively) are responsible for an avoidance response <br />                                              triggered by strong mechanical stimuli to the body (5).

However, <br />                                              recent studies show that the PVDs have a more complex morphology (7,8). <br />  <br />                                              Here, we established a genetic system to dissect the mechanisms of branch generation and <br />                                              plasticity of arborized neurons in C. elegans.

The PVDs contained repetitive <br />                                                 structural units reminiscent of multibranched candelabras or menorahs (Fig. 1A). Although <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                 the number of menorah branches varied, the menorahs appeared to develop in a stepwise <br />                                                 manner from the L2 larva to the adult (fig. S1). The stereotypical menorah structure is likely <br />                                                 to form a functional <span id='am-1' about='Thesaurus:Unit' typeof='owl:Thing'>unit</span> necessary for the PVDs mechanosensory activities. <br />  <br />                                                 Mutations in the cell fusion gene eff-1 (9,10) affected the pattern of PVDs arborization, <br />                                                 resulting in disorganized and hyperbranched phenotypes (Fig. 1B). Moreover, eff-1(ok1021) <br />                                                 mutant animals showed reduced sensitivity to strong mechanical stimuli (53%, n = 106) <br />                                                 (11). To characterize menorah disorganization in eff-1 mutants, we quantified the number of <br />                                                 processes at different degrees of the branching order (primary to senary branches; Fig. 1C <br />                                                 and fig.

In wild-type menorahs, <br />                                                 most sprouting of branches and bending of tertiary processes occurred at right angles to the <br />                                                 branches of origin (Fig. 1A). In contrast, eff-1(hy21) mutant menorahs showed varying <br />                                                 branching angles (Fig. 1B). We observed in the mutant a 10-fold increase in the number of <br />                                                 branches sprouting from the secondary branch (Fig. 1D) and a 20-fold increase in the <br />                                                 number of branches that erred and turned back 180&#194;&#176; (Fig. 1E). These phenotypes suggest <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                 that EFF-1 sculpts and maintains right-angle nonoverlapping branches. <br />  <br />                                                 Cell-specific expression of eff-1 in the PVDs (des-2p::eff-1) partially rescued neuronal eff-1 <br />                                                 phenotypes (Fig. 2C). In contrast, PVD patterning defects were not rescued by expression of <br />                                                 eff-1 in the neighboring epidermal tissue (fig. S3; dpy-7p::eff-1). In eff-1(hy21) mutants <br />                                                 expressing eff-1 in both neural and epidermal tissues (des-2p::eff-1+dpy-7p::eff-1), the <br />                                                 rescue was not significantly stronger than the rescue observed with only the PVD-specific <br />                                                 des-2p::eff-1 (fig. S3). These rescue experiments, together with expression of EFF-1::GFP <br />                                                 in the PVDs (fig. S4), provide evidence that eff-1 controls branching cell autonomously. <br />                                                 Moreover, eff-1 overexpression in the PVDs of wild-type animals reduced branching (Fig. <br />                                                 2D). The remaining branches were organized in a gradient starting from the cell body <br />                                                 toward the head and tail, where no branches could be observed. Thus, eff-1 may play a role <br />                                                 in mechanosensory neurons restricting branching in a dosage-dependent manner to produce <br />                                                 dendrite simplification (Fig. 2G). <br />  <br />                                                 The absence of excess branching in wild-type animals may reflect a situation where only the <br />                                                 appropriate branches initiate outgrowth. Alternatively, an excess of branches may be <br />                                                 generated and extended but at some later point undergo retraction, pruning, or fusion to <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                 repair branching errors. To determine how EFF-1 restricts branching, we followed the <br />                                                 behavior of branches by using three-dimensional (3D) live-imaging confocal microscopy in <br />                                                 wild-type animals overexpressing des-2p::eff-1. The tips of tertiary to senary menorah <br />                                                 branches first contacted the muscle cells, and then the dendrites detached from the menorahs <br />                                                 by fission events (Fig. 3A; arrowheads) causing spontaneous dendrite break-off (Fig. 3B; <br />                                                 arrowheads). Thus, following dynamic outgrowth, fission events eliminate extra branches. <br />  <br />                                                 To further analyze eff-1&#226;&#8364;&#8220;dependent remodeling of menorahs, we grew the eff-1(hy21ts) <br />                                                 worms at the restrictive temperature and shifted them to the permissive temperature in the <br />                                                 early L4 stage. The defective arborization pattern was static at the nonpermissive <br />                                                 temperature. Four hours after down-shifting to the permissive temperature, we observed <br />                                                 branches that met, touched, and retracted. Some branches appeared to be stably connected, <br />                                                 forming loops of different sizes and shapes (43 stable loops, n = 18; fig. S6). Because EFF-1 <br />                                                 is a fusogen, we hypothesized that transient meeting and attachment of branches expressing <br />  <br />  <br />                                                        Science.

To distinguish <br />                                                 between interbranch fasciculation and fusion, we analyzed the 3D structure of the loops by <br />                                                 generating confocal z stacks, projections, and rotations. The loops were stably connected <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                 over time (55 loops, n = 18 animals; movie S1). Next, we imaged DES-2::GFP in loops and <br />                                                 found that fluorescent particles moved freely through them. To test whether the loops <br />                                                 resulted from eff-1 activity, we incubated temperature-sensitive mutants at the restrictive <br />                                                 temperature to generate hyperbranching, then we shifted them to the permissive temperature <br />                                                 to induce expression of active EFF-1. After generating loops for 3.5 hours, we upshifted the <br />                                                 worms back to the restrictive temperature to stabilize the loops (fig. S8). We obtained a two- <br />                                                 to threefold increase in the number of loops (119 stable loops in n = 16 animals; Fig. 3C). <br />                                                 We also observed symmetric fluorescence recovery of photobleached areas within the loops <br />                                                 (fig. S7 and movie S2), indicating that the loops are continuous. Thus, eff-1 induces loop <br />                                                 formation by neurite autofusion and/or fasciculation. <br />  <br />                                                 To further demonstrate that neurites can fuse with each other, we turned to higher resolution <br />                                                 images of menorah branches and membranes. By using archival serial section transmission <br />                                                 electron micrographs [TEMs (6)], we identified arborizations derived from the PVDs. In <br />                                                 transverse sections of an adult hermaphrodite (N2U), 30- to 80-nm-diameter branches <br />                                                 sandwiched between the body wall muscles and the hypodermis were observed (Fig. 3D, <br />                                                 arrowheads). We reconstructed parallel neurites corresponding to the quaternary branches of <br />                                                 a menorah from serial sections (Fig. 3E and figs. S9 to S11). In 10 examples of PVDs and <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                 FLPL/R (highly arborized neurons anterior to the PVDs), we found 2 to 12 branches fusing <br />                                                 at the midline and forming fused longitudinal processes (Fig. 3, D and E, arrows). In no <br />                                                 cases did we observe distal dendrites fasciculate; instead these fused if they reached one <br />                                                 another. Thus, neurite-neurite auto-fusion plays a role in PVD and FLP arborization. <br />  <br />                                                 In addition to loop formation, dendrites were highly dynamic, erring, growing, and <br />                                                 retracting in wild-type worms (Fig. 4A and movie S3). PVDs overexpressing eff-1 showed <br />                                                 similar retractions but, unlike in the wild type, showed limited branch growth (Fig. 4, B and <br />                                                 C). Similarly, when eff-1(hy21ts) animals were downshifted from the restrictive to the <br />                                                 permissive temperature, we observed a 20-fold increase in the number of retracting branches <br />                                                 and a 5-fold reduction in branch growth compared with eff-1 mutants at 25&#194;&#176;C (Fig. 4, D to <br />                                                 G, and movie S1). In contrast, upshifting eff-1(hy21ts) worms resulted in excess neurite <br />                                                 growth (Fig. 4F). Thus, we propose a model in which EFF-1 autonomously induces <br />                                                 retraction of branches to simplify menorahs. <br />  <br />                                                 EFF-1 is both a sculptor of epithelial organs by cell fusion (10) and a menorah sculptor by <br />                                                 controlling dendrite bending, retraction, and fusion. The activities of this fusogen may be <br />                                                 due to its ability to induce membrane curvature, a process that is thought to constitute a <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />                                                 major driving force in membrane fusion and fission (12&#226;&#8364;&#8220;14). Proteins capable of bending <br />                                                 membranes, such as atlastins (15,16) and dynamins (17), can induce tubulation, fusion, and <br />                                                 fission (12,13). Three mechanistic principles may form and maintain branched tubes in the <br />                                                 cytoplasm and in extracellular branched filopodia or neuronal arbors such as menorahs: first, <br />                                                 assembly of specialized proteins on membranes; second, membranous tube formation <br />                                                 involving growth and bifurcation of tubes; and third, membrane bending followed by <br />                                                 membrane fusion and fission restricts excessive branching. How can EFF-1 control <br />                                                 mechanistically different processes such as dendrite fusion and retraction? Different <br />                                                 isoforms and interactions may account for diverse activities. For example, trans interactions <br />                                                 between EFF-1 on dendrites will cause autofusion, whereas assembly of large EFF-1 <br />                                                 complexes on dendrites may induce actin-mediated retraction. <br />  <br />                                                 Fig. 1. <br />                                                 PVD menorah sculpting by EFF-1. &#226;&#8364;&#339;c&#226;&#8364;&#65533; denotes cell body, small droplets are autofluorescent <br />                                                 gut granules, anterior is left, and dorsal is up.
