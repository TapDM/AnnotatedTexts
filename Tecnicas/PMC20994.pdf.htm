Interestingly, <br /> unlike wild-type FtsY which migrates extremely slowly (ap- <br /> parent molecular weight 97 kDa compared with a calculated <br /> molecular weight of 54 kDa; Fig. 3C, lane 2; see also refs. 13 <br /> and 20), the migration of mutant D92 is only moderately slower <br /> (&apos;58 kDa) compared with a calculated molecular weight of 44 <br /> kDa and D198 migrates according to its calculated molecular <br /> weight (33 kDa). Therefore, the aberrant migration of FtsY in <br /> SDSyPAGE is determined by the N-terminal sequence. <br />    The observations that we have described lead to the con- <br /> clusion that the N-terminal domain of FtsY carries an essential <br /> function. One possibility referred to above is that this domain <br /> mediates membrane targeting and attachment of FtsY. To test <br /> this hypothesis we constructed hybrids between the N- <br /> terminally truncated FtsY mutants and unrelated integral <br /> membrane proteins which have the ability to guide and anchor <br /> the mutant proteins to the membrane. We used integral <br /> membrane polypeptides from the LacY of E. coli because it is <br /> well characterized structurally (21) and contains 12 hydropho- <br /> bic membrane spanning segments (Fig. 1D). The fusion joints, <br /> connecting N-terminal fragments of LacY with the FtsY <br /> mutants, were placed at known cytoplasmic locations accord- <br /> ing to the secondary structure of the permease which has been <br /> recently updated (22). Specifically, mutants D92 and D198 were <br /> fused to the cytoplasmic loops between transmembrane seg- <br /> ments 4 and 5 (to form N4-D92), and 6 and 7 (to form <br /> N6-D198), respectively (Fig. 1D).

Functional complementation of FtsY depleted cells by <br /> anti-FtsY antibodies demonstrates, despite of the occasional,        LacY&#226;&#8364;&#8220;FtsY hybrids.

As expected, hybrid N4-D92        were transferred from chosen cultures into separate Erlenmeyers and <br /> contains part of the acidic N-terminal domain of FtsY and            induced by 0.5 mM IPTG for 2 hr.

The transformants were plated on          the ability of the FtsY mutants and the LacY&#226;&#8364;&#8220;FtsY hybrids to <br /> LB plates with or without arabinose and IPTG.

Cultures were treated as in the growth exper- <br /> plates without arabinose as well as on plates with arabinose         iments and 4 hr after FtsY depletion the cultures were induced <br /> (Fig. 2). Cells expressing N6-D198 produce smaller colonies,         by IPTG, and membrane preparations were analyzed by <br /> indicating that although this hybrid complements FtsY-               immunoblotting using anti-LacY antibodies (7).

In both cases, however, the SRP                      <br /> receptor is probably responsible for an essential step late                        <br /> during the targeting process, by placing the ribosome&#226;&#8364;&#8220;nascent              <br />                                                                                    <br /> chain&#226;&#8364;&#8220;SRP complex near the translocation machinery on the                   <br /> target membrane.
