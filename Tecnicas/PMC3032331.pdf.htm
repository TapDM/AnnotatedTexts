However, their function and mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here we show that PRELI, a mammalian LEA- <br /> containing homolog of yeast Ups1p, can associate with dynamin-like GTPase Optic Atrophy-1 (OPA1) and contribute to the <br /> maintenance of mitochondrial morphology. Accordingly, PRELI can uphold mitochondrial membrane potential (DWm) and <br /> enhance respiratory chain (RC) function, shown by its capacity to induce complex-I/NADH dehydrogenase and ATP synthase <br /> expression, increase oxygen consumption and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. PRELI can also inhibit cell <br /> death induced by STS, TNF-a or UV irradiation. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo dominant-negative overexpression of mutant <br /> PRELI/LEA  (lacking the LEA motif) and transient in vitro PRELI-specific knockdown can render lymphocytes vulnerable to <br /> apoptosis, cause mouse embryo lethality and revert the resistance of lymphoma cells to induced death. Collectively, these data <br /> support the long-presumed notion of LEA protein-dependent mechanisms of cytoprotection and suggest that PRELI interacts <br /> with OPA1 to maintain mitochondria structures intact, sustain balanced ion /proton &#195;&#190; gradients, promote oxidative <br /> phosphorylation reactions, regulate pro- and antiapoptotic protein traffic and enable cell responses to induced death.
