The function of nuclear ZPR1 has not been defined. <br />           Here we demonstrate that ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus of proliferating cells. The <br />           role of ZPR1 was examined using a gene disruption strategy. Cells lacking ZPR1 are not <br />           viable. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the loss of ZPR1 caused disruption of <br />           nucleolar function, including preribosomal RNA expression. These data establish ZPR1 <br />           as an essential protein that is required for normal nucleolar function in proliferating cells. <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                          repress the basal state of the EGF receptor tyrosine ki- <br />                                                                       nase (Galcheva-Gargova et al., 1996). <br /> ZPR1 is a zinc finger protein that is present in the cyto-              Treatment with mitogens, including EGF, causes <br /> plasm of quiescent cells (Galcheva-Gargova et al., 1996).             translocation of cytoplasmic ZPR1 into the nucleus (Gal- <br /> Coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that                      cheva-Gargova et al., 1996).

It is likely that a conserved mechanism would               <br /> not involve cytoplasmic retention by cell surface recep-              <br /> tor tyrosine kinases because such molecules are not ex-              <br /> pressed in yeast. Clearly, further studies are required to            <br /> define the mechanism of proliferation-associated nuclear             <br /> redistribution of ZPR1 and to determine the significance             <br /> of the interaction of ZPR1 with receptor tyrosine kinases           <br /> in mammalian cells.                                                <br />    Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that                  <br /> ZPR1 is accumulated within a subnuclear compartment,             <br /> the nucleolus (Figure 2). Fractionation experiments dem-           <br /> onstrated that ZPR1 was not an integral component of              <br /> the fibrillar or granular compartments of the nucleolous          <br /> (Figure 3), suggesting that either ZPR1 is peripherally            <br /> associated with one of these nucleolar compartments or            <br /> is located in a distinct subregion of the nucleolus. How-           <br /> ever, the nucleolar location of ZPR1 required RNA, sug-             <br /> gesting that nucleolar integrity was required for the ac-            <br /> cumulation of ZPR1 (Figure 4). The movement of ZPR1                  <br /> from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus in response to pro-              <br /> liferative signals indicates that ZPR1 may have a signal-           <br /> ing role. However, the nuclear function of ZPR1 has not               <br /> been established by previous studies (Galcheva-Gargova              <br /> et al., 1996).                                                       <br />    The major functions of the nucleolus are thought to be             <br /> the transcription of rRNA genes, the processing of the               <br /> pre-rRNA precursor to form mature rRNA, and the as-                 <br /> sembly of rRNA into preribosomal particles (Shaw and                 <br /> Jordan, 1995). Because ZPR1 is a nucleolar protein that is          <br /> essential for cell viability, a plausible role for ZPR1 is to       <br /> contribute to one step in the process of rRNA expression.            <br />                                                                      <br /> Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the re- <br /> pression of zpr11 gene expression in fission yeast caused           <br /> a marked decrease in the level of pre-rRNA (Figure 7C).              <br />                                                                    <br /> This decreased rRNA is likely to account for the growth <br /> arrest (Figure 7A) and decreased protein translation (Fig-           <br /> ure 7D) observed after repression of zpr11 gene expres-              <br /> sion.                                                                <br />    The results of the present study provide direct exper-             <br /> imental evidence that the cytoplasmic protein ZPR1 re-               <br /> distributes to the nucleolus in proliferating cells and that          <br /> ZPR1 is required for normal nucleolar function. Further               <br /> studies are required to determine the molecular basis for            <br /> the role of ZPR1 in these processes.                                 <br />                                                                       <br />  <br /> </body></html>
