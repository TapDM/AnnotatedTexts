This G&#226;&#180;&#353;1 <br /> residue is required for aminoacylation of tRNAHis by histidyl-tRNA <br /> synthetase, both in vitro and in vivo. The guanine nucleotide <br /> addition reaction catalyzed by Thg1 extends the polynucleotide <br /> chain in the reverse (3&#226;&#180;&#8226;-5&#226;&#180;&#8226;) direction of other known polymerases, <br /> albeit by one nucleotide. Here, we show that alteration of the 3&#226;&#180;&#8226; <br /> end of the Thg1 substrate tRNAHis unleashes an unexpected re- <br /> verse polymerase activity of wild-type Thg1, resulting in the 3&#226;&#180;&#8226;-5&#226;&#180;&#8226; <br /> addition of multiple nucleotides to the tRNA, with efficiency <br /> comparable to the G&#226;&#180;&#353;1 addition reaction.

Although Thg1 normally adds a single guanine <br /> nucleotide to the 5&#226;&#172;&#732; end of tRNAHis, Thg1 can add multiple                          a tRNAHis C73CAA variant results in a G&#226;&#171;&#186;2 product at higher <br /> guanine nucleotides to a variant tRNAHis that bears C73 instead                     concentrations of Thg1 but no G&#226;&#171;&#186;3 product (Fig. 2Bc), whereas <br /> of the A73 that is universally conserved in eukaryotic tRNAHis                      reaction with a tRNAHis C73ACA variant yields only a G&#226;&#171;&#186;1 <br /> species (4, 15). We demonstrated this phenomenon with a <br />                                                                                     product (Fig. 2Bd). Thus, it appears that formation of additional <br /> sensitive assay that exploits the phosphatase resistance that <br />                                                                                     products depends on the identity of the A73CCA 3&#226;&#172;&#732; end of tRNA. <br /> occurs when G&#226;&#171;&#186;1 is added to 5&#226;&#172;&#732; end-labeled tRNAHis (14). After <br />                                                                                        Examination of Thg1 activity with the corresponding ppp- <br /> incubation of tRNAHis with Thg1, treatment with RNase A and <br /> phosphatase yields the internally labeled trimer G[32P]pGpC if                      tRNA substrates shows that Thg1 has the same spectrum of <br /> G&#226;&#171;&#186;1 has been added, or 32Pi from unreacted substrate (Fig. 2A),                     products with this alternatively activated tRNAHis substrate as <br /> which are well separated by TLC (Fig. 2Ba). However, reaction                       with the p-tRNAHis species, which require activation by ATP <br /> of Thg1 with a tRNAHis variant bearing A73C (tRNAHis C73CCA)                        (Fig. 3A). As measured by primer extension product <span id='am-4' about='xsp:length' typeof='owl:Thing'>length</span> and <br /> also yields a prominent second product and a small amount of                        intensity, Thg1 efficiently adds a single guanine nucleotide <br /> a third product at higher concentrations of Thg1 (Fig. 2Bb).                        residue to ppp-tRNAHis (Fig. 3Aa), whereas up to three nucle- <br /> These additional products comigrate on TLC with chemically                          otides are added to a ppp-tRNAHis C73CCA variant (Fig. 3Ab), <br /> synthesized oligonucleotide standards corresponding to G&#226;&#171;&#186;2 and                      two nucleotides are added to a ppp-tRNAHis C73CAA variant <br /> G&#226;&#171;&#186;3 reaction products (Fig. 2C), and they are presumed to be                        (Fig. 3Ac), and a single nucleotide is added to a ppp-tRNAHis <br /> these species because only GTP and ATP are present in the                           C73ACA variant (Fig. 3Ad). We conclude that Thg1 catalyzes <br /> reactions, and all reaction products are sensitive to RNase T1,                     authentic 3&#226;&#172;&#732;-5&#226;&#172;&#732; reverse polymerization, defined as extension of <br /> producing Gp (data not shown). Similarly, reaction of Thg1 with                     the 5&#226;&#172;&#732; end of a polynucleotide chain by more than a single <br />  <br /> Jackman and Phizicky                                                                                          PNAS &#229;&#8230;&#169; June 6, 2006 &#229;&#8230;&#169; vol. 103 &#229;&#8230;&#169; no. 23 &#229;&#8230;&#169; 8641 <br />  nucleotide. Because addition of multiple guanine nucleotides to <br /> the ppp-tRNAHis variants is at least as efficient in the absence of <br /> ATP (Fig. 3Ae), we conclude that Thg1 does not require ATP to <br /> activate the 5&#226;&#172;&#732; end of the RNA for multiple-nucleotide additions; <br /> rather, we infer that the second and third guanine nucleotide <br /> additions, like the first guanine nucleotide addition, are powered <br /> by hydrolysis of pyrophosphate from the growing polynucleotide <br /> chain. Moreover, the slightly enhanced addition activity ob- <br /> served with the ppp-tRNAHis C73CCA variant in the absence of <br /> ATP suggests that ATP in fact inhibits the multiple-addition <br /> reaction. Because yeast Thg1 purified from E. coli exhibits the <br /> same multiple-nucleotide addition activity, we conclude that this <br /> activity is intrinsic to Thg1 protein (Fig. 3B). <br />    The addition of multiple guanine nucleotides by Thg1 is an <br /> efficient RNA reverse polymerization activity. Thg1 reverse <br /> polymerization with tRNAHis C73CCA and other variants occurs <br /> with similar efficiency (Figs. 2B and 3A) and on the same time <br /> scale (data not shown) as for the addition of G&#226;&#171;&#186;1 to wild-type <br /> tRNAHis, whether the compared substrates are ppp-tRNAHis <br /> species or p-tRNAHis species. Furthermore, there is an element <br /> of template dependence in the reverse polymerization because <br /> the number of guanine nucleotides added to the 5&#226;&#172;&#732; end of both <br /> p-tRNAHis and ppp-tRNAHis variants appears to be directed by <br /> the number of consecutive cytidine residues at the 3&#226;&#172;&#732; end, <br /> starting at nucleotide 73 (Figs. 2B and 3). Indeed, up to five <br /> guanine residues are added across from the 3&#226;&#172;&#732; end of tRNAHis <br /> C73CCCCA (Fig. 3C).                                                   Fig. 4.
