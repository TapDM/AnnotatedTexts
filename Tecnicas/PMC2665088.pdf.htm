Thr385 is required for caspase cleavage of dSREBP. The P4-P1&#226;&#8364;&#8482; positions are <br /> shown for reference. The down arrow indicates the scissile bond. Cleavage of dSREBP is completely <br /> abolished in T385S and T385A mutants (lanes 4 and 6). In the P1&#226;&#8364;&#8482; position, the well-conserved Ala <br /> residue may be substituted by Phe without preventing cleavage. Other Drosophila substrates of Drice, <br /> such as the D116TTD site in rep1 (ICAD) and the E275ETD site in CAD, also have a Thr residue at P2 <br /> (3,4) and these residues are well conserved among other Drosophila species. The experiment was <br /> conducted as described for Figure 3B. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                                 S2 <br />  <br /> &#194;&#160; <br />                                                Amarneh, et al. <br />  <br />  <br />                                         SUPPLEMENTAL METHODS <br />  <br /> RNAi treatment: <br /> The following oligonucletide sequences were designed from published transcript sequences in <br /> Flybase.org and were used to produce double stranded RNAs for RNAi experiments as described <br /> previously (1): <br />  <br /> Dcp1:             5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAAGATGACCGACGAGTGCG-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> Dcp1R:            5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAGAAAGTCGGCGTGTATGG-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> Drice:            5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAACGATCACACAGATG-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> DriceR:           5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGTTCGGCGCACAGGCTC-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> Dream:            5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGGGTTGGTGGAGCAAGAAAAG-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> DreamR:           5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATTTTTGGTGTCTTGATGTTGGG-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> Decay:            5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGGTCAGCAGCAAAATC-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> DecayR:           5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATTTCCTTCATCTGGTTG-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> Damm:             5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATATGACAGCAACAGG-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> DammR:            5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATTCGAACCTGTCATAG-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> Dronc:            5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACTCGAGATTGGAATG-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> DroncR:           5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATATCGACCACAGATC-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> Dredd:            5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;- TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATCAGCGAGTGCAATTTATCGGC -3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br /> DreddR:           5&#226;&#8364;&#8482;- TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGCTCCTTCTGGTCAGCCAGTCC-3&#226;&#8364;&#8482; <br />  <br />      Double-stranded RNA corresponding to the Drosophila caspases was added and the cells incubated as <br />         described.
