In addi- <br />      the nucleus could be achieved by increasing the list of proteins that                    tion, shuttling mRNA-binding proteins function in mRNA export. So <br />      are involved in this process. Here, we present the identification of                     far, several have been identified in yeast, including Pab1, Hrp1, Nab2, <br />      Gbp2 as a novel shuttling RNA-binding protein in Saccharomyces                           Yra1 and Npl3 (Anderson et al., 1993; Wilson et al., 1994; Zenklusen <br />      cerevisiae. Nuclear import of Gbp2 is dependent on the receptor                          &amp; Stutz, 2001). Only one of them, Npl3, contains a serine/arginine <br />      Mtr10 and the serine/arginine-specific protein kinase Sky1.

Mutants of NPL3 show strong <br />      Gbp2 to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, deletion of MTR10 only also                        mRNA-export defects, which suggests a role in mRNA export from the <br />      causes an increase in poly(A)+ RNA binding by Gbp2, suggesting a                         nucleus (Lee et al., 1996). In fact, binding of Npl3 to mRNA seems to <br />      role of Mtr10 in the dissociation of Gbp2 from mRNA in the cyto-                         be crucial for the formation of an export-competent mRNP, as its dis- <br />      plasm. The nuclear export of Gbp2 is always coupled to mRNA                              sociation results in an export-incompetent mRNP (Krebber et al., <br />      export and is dependent on continuous RNA polymerase II transcrip-                       1999). Npl3 is imported into the nucleus by the import receptor Mtr10 <br />      tion and mRNA-export factors. Although GBP2 is not essential for                         (Pemberton et al., 1997; Senger et al., 1998). The carboxy-terminal SR <br />      normal cell growth, overexpression of this gene is toxic and causes a                    domain of Npl3 is phosphorylated on serine 411 by the only SR- <br />      nuclear retention of bulk poly(A)+ RNA. Together, our findings clearly                   specific protein kinase in yeast, Sky1 (Yun &amp; Fu, 2000; Gilbert et al., <br />      show an involvement of Gbp2 in mRNA transport. In addition, as a                         2001). It has been suggested that phosphorylation of Npl3 by Sky1 <br />      non-essential protein, Gbp2 also has the interesting potential to be                     may increase the binding affinity of Npl3 to its import receptor, Mtr10 <br />      spatially or temporally regulated.

It will be challenging to identify     <br /> specific Gbp2-bound mRNAs and thus learn more about potential                  <br /> cis-elements.                                                               <br />     Many proteins accompany mRNAs on their way to the ribosomes                 <br /> and it is to be expected that association and dissociation of all pro-      <br /> teins on the mRNP is tightly regulated.
