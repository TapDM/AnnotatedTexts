The effect of UBR5A depletion on polysomes is more pronounced in rich media. UBHY-R cells were cultured in the indicated galactose-containing media <br /> (A and C) until reaching mid-log phase.

This may reflect a disparity between                    translation initiation proceeds in the absence of eIF5A (Fig. 1 <br /> mammalian and fungal translation (10). The average difference                     and Fig. S1), supplementing the factor in vitro (Fig. 3B and <br /> in slopes we observed, comparing added eIF5A(dhp) or eIF5A                        Fig. S6) directly restores translation activity on endogenous <br /> (hyp) with buffer alone at points after 20 min, was 1.8 &#194;&#177; 0.1                     messages to a degree that is surprisingly consistent with multiple <br /> among nine experiments and multiple depleted lysates.
