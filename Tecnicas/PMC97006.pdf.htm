Little is known <br />          about gene regulation in P. carinii. The removal of introns <span id='am-3' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> pre-mRNA requires spliceosomal recognition <br />          of the intron-exon boundary. In S. pombe and higher eukaryotes, this boundary and a branch site within the <br />          intron are conserved. We recently demonstrated that P. carinii cdc2 cDNA can complement S. pombe containing <br />          conditional mutations of cdc2, an essential gene involved in cell cycle regulation. We next tested whether P. <br />          carinii genomic cdc2 (with six introns) could also complement S. pombe cdc2 mutants and found genomic <br />          sequences incapable of this activity. Reverse transcriptase PCR confirmed the inability of the S. pombe cdc2 <br />          mutants to splice the P. carinii genomic cdc2. Analysis of 83 introns from 19 P. carinii protein-encoding genes <br />          demonstrated that the sequence GTWWDW functions as a donor consensus in P. carinii, whereas YAG serves <br />          as an acceptor consensus. These sequences are similar in S. pombe; however, a branch site sequence was not <br />          found in the P. carinii genes studied. <br />  <br />  <br />    Pneumocystis carinii is a significant cause of morbidity and             the cdc (cell division control) molecules (7&#226;&#8364;&#8220;9, 12, 21).

Consequently, little is known about                A number of cDNA sequences from organisms as diverse as <br /> gene regulation and expression in P. carinii.                               plants and mammals have successfully been used to comple- <br />    The removal of intervening sequences (introns) from pre-                 ment S. pombe temperature-sensitive mutants in cell division <br /> mRNA is an important step in gene regulation, requiring a                   control molecules. We have recently shown that the P. carinii <br /> complex number of splicing molecules and an active spliceo-                 cdc2 cDNA can complement temperature-sensitive S. pombe <br /> somal structure which recognizes distinct features of introns in            mutants in cdc2, allowing the yeast to proliferate at the restric- <br /> order to permit intron excision.

For instance, Nurse <br /> sequences between donor and acceptor splice junctions are not               and coworkers have spliced the viral simian virus 40 (SV40) <br /> random.

Since P. carinii is phyloge- <br /> GTRAGT for the donor site consensus and (Y)nNYAG/G for                      netically similar to S. pombe, we hypothesized that P. carinii <br /> the acceptor site consensus (15). While these rules apply to                introns might be spliced in S. pombe as well. Accordingly, we <br /> protein-encoding genes, they do not pertain to mitochondrial,               tested whether genomic P. carinii cdc2 sequences would com- <br /> tRNA, or rRNA splice junction sequences (15).

Both   <br /> SV40 introns had the S. pombe branch site sequence, and yet             <br /> the SV40 large-T antigen intron differed in the donor site        <br /> sequence, replacing an adenine at nucleotide 5 of the donor                   <br /> sequence (conserved in S. pombe) with a thymine. This differ- <br /> ence in the donor site was hypothesized to inhibit splicing (10).    <br /> Indeed, P. carinii cdc2 introns four and six have a thymine at        <br /> nucleotide position 5 in the donor site sequence (Table 3).                       <br /> These differences may have contributed to the lack of comple-  <br /> mentation of the P. carinii genomic cdc2 gene in the S. pombe    <br /> cdc2 mutants if the introns preceding these had not been cor-                  <br /> rectly spliced, but we determined that none of the six introns          <br /> were spliced.                               <br />    These data demonstrate that S. pombe could not correctly                <br /> splice the six introns from the P. carinii cdc2 gene. Although we            <br /> tested only a single P. carinii gene for splicing, the number of                  <br /> introns tested suggests that S. pombe may not be an ideal   <br /> organism to study P. carinii gene regulation since no introns   <br /> were spliced. P. carinii may use alternative modes of splicing             <br /> introns from pre-mRNA, such as trans splicing, or may have          <br /> evolved unique branch site recognition strategies for intron     <br /> splicing. Additionally, P. carinii may require novel snRNPs and          <br /> other spliceosomal components. Clearly, further investigations           <br /> into the mechanisms of RNA processing in P. carinii, which                      <br /> may yield new insights into the genetic regulation of this im-  <br /> portant pulmonary pathogen, are needed.                                    <br />    Nucleotide sequence accession numbers.
