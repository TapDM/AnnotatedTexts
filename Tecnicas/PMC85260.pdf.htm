Four mutants each carrying a single mutation in the essential region were sensitive to <br />           6-azauracil (6AU), which inhibits transcription elongation by depleting the intracellular pool of GTP and UTP. <br />           Both 6AU sensitivity and temperature-sensitive phenotypes of these rpb6 mutants were suppressed by over- <br />           expression of TFIIS, a transcription elongation factor. In agreement with the genetic studies, the mutant RNA <br />           polymerases containing the mutant Rpb6 subunits showed reduced affinity for TFIIS, as measured by a <br />           pull-down assay of TFIIS-RNA polymerase II complexes using a fusion form of TFIIS with glutathione <br />           S-transferase. Moreover, the direct interaction between TFIIS and RNA polymerase II was competed by the <br />           addition of Rpb6. Taken together, the results lead us to propose that Rpb6 plays a role in the interaction <br />           between RNA polymerase II and the transcription elongation factor TFIIS. <br />  <br />  <br />    The RNA polymerase II of Schizosaccharomyces pombe con-                     The essential role of Rpb6 in the formation of functional RNA <br /> sists of 12 subunits (35), corresponding to RPB1 to RPB12 of                   polymerase II has also been supported by the findings that (i) <br /> the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II (44, 45). Two                   S. cerevisiae RPB6 is an essential gene for cell growth (25, 46); <br /> large subunits, Rpb1 and Rpb2, are the homologues of the &#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#172;&#732;                    (ii) an RPB6 mutation of S. cerevisiae can suppress a temper- <br /> and &#226;&#65533;&#164; subunits of prokaryotic RNA polymerase, while the two                    ature-sensitive mutation of RPB1 (5); (iii) Rpo26 (identical to <br /> small subunits, Rpb3 and Rpb11, have limited sequence ho-                      RPB6) of S. cerevisiae plays a role in the assembly of both RNA <br /> mologies with the N-terminal assembly domain of the bacterial                  polymerases I and II (28); and (iv) an S. cerevisiae mutant RNA <br /> &#226;&#65533;&#163; subunit. These four subunits, Rpb1, Rpb2, Rpb3, and Rpb11,                   polymerase I lacking the ABC23 subunit (identical to RPB6) is <br /> together are considered to form the enzyme core which corre-                   virtually inactive in RNA synthesis in vitro but regains activity <br /> sponds to the bacterial core enzyme, with the subunit structure                upon the addition of RPB6 (21). The Rpb6 homologues exist <br /> &#226;&#65533;&#163;2&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#65533;&#164;&#226;&#172;&#732; (19, 35). In the case of RNA polymerase formation in                     in not only eukaryotic RNA polymerases but also archaeal (20) <br /> Escherichia coli, subunit assembly proceeds sequentially in the                and some viral (23) RNA polymerases.

The assembly core of S. pombe was identified as an                 merases (34). Together, these observations suggest that Rpb6 <br /> Rpb2-Rpb3-Rpb11 ternary complex that corresponds to the                        plays an essential role(s) in the assembly and/or functions of <br /> &#226;&#65533;&#163;2&#226;&#65533;&#164; complex (19).
