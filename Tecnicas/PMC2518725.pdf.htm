SKA2 interactions with GR <br />  <br />          Unexpectedly, we found that in cells overexpressing a GR       tissue. The impact of depletion of SKA2 on apoptotic- and <br />       construct, there was partial SKA2 translocation to the nucleus    proliferation-associated genes suggests that SKA2 may play a <br />       following GC treatment. This suggests that there may be           role in regulation of cancer cell proliferation. <br />       functional interaction between the two proteins in the <br />       cytoplasm and that SKA2, which lacks a nuclear localization <br />       domain, is being &#226;&#8364;&#732;drawn&#226;&#8364;&#8482; into the nucleus by the movement of      Declaration of Interest <br />       GR. However, this effect appears to require overexpression of <br />       GR to be seen clearly. This suggests that under particular        The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived <br />       conditions, as seen in breast cancer or GR overexpression, the    as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported. <br />       nuclear exclusion of SKA2 in interphase is lost, with possible <br />       consequences for cell proliferation or survival. <br />          As SKA2 was found to interact with the GR, its effect on        <br />       GR transactivation function was sought. Overexpressed <br />       SKA2 resulted in modest enhancement of GR transactivation,        <br />       while knockdown of SKA2 markedly inhibited GR                     <br />       transactivation. This supports a functional interaction            <br />       between the two proteins. SKA2 also appears to have a role <br />       in GC inhibition of cell proliferation, in that, knockdown of <br />       SKA2 prevented the decrease in cell number seen with Dex           <br />       treatment. <br />          SKA2 protein expression was inhibited by agents that share    <br />       anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic actions on A549 cells. Dex    <br />       had profound inhibitory effects on SKA2 expression and         <br />       given that GCs are widely used in the induction phase of <br />       anti-cancer chemotherapy, this has implications for cell <br />       cycle control and appropriate chromosomal segregation,             <br />       through interference with the spindle checkpoint (Hanisch <br />       et al. 2006).                                                  <br />          To explore SKA2 function further, it was overexpressed in        <br />       the SKA2 deficient cell line HepG2. This significantly            <br />       enhanced proliferation following incubation with IGF-I, <br />                                                                          <br />       which suggests involvement of SKA2 in either growth factor          <br />       signalling or cell survival/proliferation pathways. This is        <br />       supported by knockdown of SKA2 in A549 cells, which                  <br />       produced an increase in cells arrested in mitosis as previously    <br />       shown for HeLa S3 cells (Hanisch et al. 2006).                     <br />          Cells were subjected to transcript profiling and genes were    <br />       identified where expression was regulated by both SKA2             <br />       siRNAs, but not by a non-targeting siRNA. The SKA2               <br />       transcript was found in this group of genes to be markedly <br />                                                                          <br />       repressed, confirming the success of the knockdown approach.       <br />       Functional grouping of identified genes using gene ontology         <br />       approaches identified significant enrichment in pathways            <br />       regulating cell survival, cell proliferation and also cytokine/   <br />       growth factor action, as evidenced by the list of significantly      <br />       regulated genes clustered in these pathways (Table 1).            <br />          To conclude, we have identified and functionally charac-         <br />       terized a novel GR-interacting protein, which we isolated         <br />       from a human SCLC cell line. It has recently been identified <br />                                                                          <br />       as SKA2, a protein involved in regulating anaphase onset in         <br />       HeLa S3 cells. Our studies show that SKA2 is expressed not          <br />       only in a range of cell lines but also found in human lung and    <br />       breast cancer tissue. In cells overexpressing GR, treatment         <br />       with GC causes SKA2 to be co-localized with the GR in the         <br />       nucleus. Interestingly, SKA2 is found predominantly in the          <br />       nucleus in breast tumours but in the cytoplasm in normal            <br /> </body></html>
