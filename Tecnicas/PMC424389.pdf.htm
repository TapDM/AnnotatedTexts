We conclude that the <br /> human Nar1p-like proteins cannot replace the cellular task of <br /> Nar1p in yeast. Nevertheless, the lack of complementation of <br /> Nar1p-deficient yeast cells by the human genes does not <br /> exclude that these proteins may fulfil orthologous functions <br /> in yeast and man. <br />  <br /> Nar1p is predominantly localised in the cytosol <br /> The subcellular localisation of Nar1p was studied by in situ <br /> immunofluorescence. Yeast cells overexpressing NAR1 were <br /> labelled using an affinity-purified antibody followed by in- <br /> cubation with a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody. <br /> The immunofluorescence was distributed in a similar fashion <br /> as that found after labelling with monoclonal antibodies <br /> against Pgk1p (phosphoglycerate kinase), a cytosolic marker <br /> protein (Figure 4A). The signal was specific for overproduced <br /> Nar1p, because no fluorescence was detectable in wild-type <br /> cells. Apparently, the endogenous levels of Nar1p were too <br /> low for detection by our immunostaining procedure. This <br /> result was in good agreement with the low expression levels <br /> of NAR1 in wild-type cells as determined by our immunoblot <br /> analysis and by systematic protein expression analysis <br /> (Figure 3A; Ghaemmaghami et al, 2003). <br />    Because overexpression can occasionally lead to artefacts, <br /> we used subcellular fractionation of wild-type and Nar1p- <br /> overproducing cells as an independent method for Nar1p <br /> localisation. Cells were converted into spheroplasts, lysed, <br /> separated by centrifugation into post-mitochondrial super- <br /> natant and pellet fractions, and the fractions were analysed <br /> by protein blot analysis. Endogenous and overproduced <br /> Nar1p behaved similarly and were found in the post-mito- <br /> chondrial supernatant fraction (ca. 80% of total) as well as in <br /> the pellet fraction containing crude mitochondria and other <br /> organelles (Figure 4B, left). In the supernatant fraction, a <br /> band of smaller mass was found, which, based on its <br /> immunoreactivity and expression <span id='am-160' about='xsp:pattern' typeof='owl:Thing'>pattern</span>, is a degradation <br /> product of Nar1p.
