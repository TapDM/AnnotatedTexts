Growth of the resultant strains was as- <br /> sayed after restreaking to rich medium. This method al- <br /> lowed us to assess if any mrs6 mutants constructed were <br /> able to supply the essential function of MRS6. As a test to <br /> confirm the feasibility of this approach, a double mutant, <br /> G53A-G55A, was introduced into MRS6. Based on the <br /> crystal structure of GDI, the conserved nature of these <br /> residues, and their buried location in the protein (Schalk <br /> et al., 1996), we predicted that this double mutant would <br /> affect the structural integrity of Mrs6p, as it does for GDI <br /> (Schalk et al., 1996; Wu et al., 1998; Luan et al., 1999), and <br /> lead to a complete loss of function through misfolding. In- <br /> deed, the double mutant failed to yield Leu&#226;&#171;&#185; Ura&#226;&#171;&#186; strains <br /> after streaking to 5-FOA plates, indicating noncomple- <br /> mentation of the mrs6&#226;&#338;&#172; null mutation and thus confirming <br /> the validity of this assay (see below, Table II). <br />  <br /> Generation of Single Point Mutants Partially Defective <br /> in Mrs6p Function <br /> Mutation of conserved residues in SCRs 1B and 3B found <br /> at the apex of GDI affect the ability of the &#226;&#65533;&#163;-GDI to bind <br /> Rab3A in vitro (Schalk et al., 1996) and for function in <br /> yeast in vivo (Luan et al., 1999). Therefore, we used                            Figure 2.

A <br /> similar result has been observed for GDI (Schalk et al., <br /> 1996; Wu et al., 1998; Luan et al., 1999, 2000). As vacuolar <br /> protein transport is not required for growth of yeast, while <br /> ER to Golgi complex transport is essential, the kinetic de- <br /> lay of CPY transport to the Golgi complex observed in the <br /> presence of the R293A mutant is consistent with the re- <br /> duced rate of growth of this mutant in the mrs6&#226;&#338;&#172; null <br /> strain (Table I). <br />    These results provide direct support for the interpreta- <br /> tion that REP interacts differentially with Rabs to modu- <br /> late the availability of the active, prenylated form Rab for <br /> distinct transport steps in the exocytic pathway.

In con-                         <br /> trast, REP1 is confined to a more limited spectrum of tis-                     <br /> sues, such as the RPE (Seabra et al., 1992b; Andres et al.,                         <br /> 1993). The differential tissue distribution of this REP iso-                     <br /> form combined with our observations that residues in the                <br /> Rab-binding region contribute to selective activity in Rab                       <br /> recognition and recycling (Schalk et al., 1996; Wu et al.,                       <br /> 1998; Luan et al., 1999) indicates a specialized role in han-               <br /> dling subsets of RPE-specific Rabs. Such specialization                            <br /> may contribute to maintenance of specific types of Rab-                     <br /> dependent vesicle traffic in these tissues (Seabra et al.,                          <br /> 1995). By analogy to the effects of various mutants in                          <br /> Mrs6p, our results now demonstrate that the deficiency in                         <br /> CHM may be overcome by only a modest level of in-                                   <br /> creased expression of REP1 or through selective augmen-                       <br /> tation of REP2 function to facilitate prenylation of REP1-                        <br /> specific Rabs.                                                                     <br /> </body></html>
