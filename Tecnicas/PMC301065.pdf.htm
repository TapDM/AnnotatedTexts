SMS1 encodes a 16.5-kDa protein that contains several potential membrane- <br />          spanning domains. The Smsl protein is homologous to the carboxyl-terminal domain of <br />          the Mas6 protein. Like Mas6p, Smslp is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and <br />          is an essential protein. Depletion of Smslp <span id='am-3' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> cells causes defects in the import of several <br />          mitochondrial precursor proteins, suggesting that Smslp is a new inner membrane import <br />          component. Our observations raise the possibility that Smslp and Mas6p act together to <br />          translocate proteins across the inner membrane. <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                  sors occurs initially through contact sites between the <br />                                                               inner and outer membranes (Schleyer and Neupert, <br /> Because most mitochondrial proteins are encoded on            1985; Pon et al., 1989), but each membrane appears to <br /> nuclear genes, mitochondrial biogenesis depends on the        have its own independent translocation machinery <br /> import of proteins synthesized in the cytosol (for review     (Ohba and Schatz, 1987; Hwang et al., 1989; Mayer et <br /> see Attardi and Schatz, 1988; Pfanner and Neupert,            al., 1993).

The DNA sequence of SMS1 suggests that <br /> Smslp is synthesized without a typical amino-terminal                      <br /> presequence, and there was no evidence of presequence <br /> removal when Smslp was imported into isolated mi-                 <br /> tochondria. The import of Smslp is thus similar to                 <br /> Mas6p, in that the mitochondrial targeting signal ap-               <br /> parently resides in the mature protein.                             <br />    When we compared the Smsl protein to sequences                          <br /> in available databases, Mas6p was identified as the most          <br /> homologous protein.
