Previous studies of Bacillus subtilis RNase P, containing a Type B RNA subunit, <br /> showed that its cognate protein subunit increases the affinity of metal ions important for catalysis, but the functional role of <br /> these ions is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the Mg2+ dependence of the catalytic step for Escherichia coli RNase P, which <br /> contains a more common Type A RNA subunit, is also modulated by its cognate protein subunit (C5), indicating that this <br /> property is fundamental to P protein. To monitor specifically the binding of active site metal ions, we analyzed quantitatively <br /> the rescue by Cd2+ of an inhibitory Rp phosphorothioate modification at the pre-tRNA cleavage site. The results show that <br /> binding of C5 protein increases the apparent affinity of the rescuing Cd2+, providing evidence that C5 protein enhances metal <br /> ion affinity in the active site, and thus is likely to contribute significantly to rate enhancement at physiological metal ion <br /> concentrations. <br /> Keywords: ribozyme; catalysis; ribonucleoprotein; RNase P; active site <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                                   collaborate to achieve specific physiological function is an <br />                                                                                important goal. <br /> The biological functions of RNA and protein are intimately <br />                                                                                   A ribonucleoprotein enzyme in which the protein sub- <br /> related and extensive structural and functional studies <br />                                                                                <span id='am-2' about='Thesaurus:Unit' typeof='owl:Thing'>unit</span> plays a key role in specificity and catalysis is ribonu- <br /> reveal that RNA binding proteins can modulate RNA <br />                                                                                clease P, which catalyzes the 59-end maturation of tRNA <br /> function by binding to and stabilizing specific conforma- <br />                                                                                (Hsieh et al. 2004; Kazantsev and Pace 2006).

(B) Interpretation <br /> of the concentration dependent rescue of the Rp phosphorothioate <br /> modification by Cd2+. Because the krel analysis controls for non- <br /> specific effects of Cd2+, the cooperative nature of the Cd2+-dependent <br /> rescue suggests that two rescuing metal ions interact with the single <br /> sulfur modification, which reflects two metal ions binding in the <br /> P RNA active site for the native, unmodified substrate. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> active site metal ion binding is at least threefold higher for <br /> P RNA than the RNA&#226;&#8364;&#8220;protein complex. <br />  <br /> DISCUSSION <br /> If the Cd2+ rescue experiments accurately reflect the <br /> interactions of Mg2+ interactions with the reactive phos- <br /> phate, then the observed increase in apparent Mg2+ affinity <br /> observed in Figure 2 in part reflects active site metal ion <br /> binding.
