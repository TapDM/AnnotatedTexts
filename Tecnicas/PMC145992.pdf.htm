Note that the titration points for HsmtSSB, HsEcSSB and EcoSSB <br /> &#226;&#710;&#8224;116&#226;&#8364;&#8220;167 are located on nearly straight lines and there is almost no bending <br /> toward saturation in the accessible range of poly(rU) concentration. This <br /> indicates that HsmtSSB and EcoSSB &#226;&#710;&#8224;116&#226;&#8364;&#8220;167 bind very weakly but with             Subunit exchange <br /> reasonable fluorescence quench to poly(rU). <br />                                                                                  Formation of mixed tetramers can be demonstrated in vitro by <br />                                                                                  chemical crosslinking of the subunits with dimethylsuberimidate <br />                                                                                  and analyzing the products on a denaturing PAGE.

If two different SSB proteins form tetramers <br /> however, could complement the N-terminal mutation G15D. A                        in all possible combinations then chemical crosslinking leads to <br /> likely mechanism of this complementation is the formation of                     four trimeric and five tetrameric species.

The band corresponding to a heterodimer is indicated           <br /> by an arrow. Lack of heterodimer formation in lanes 2 and 4 is indicated by an     <br /> asterisk.                                                                          <br /> protein cannot form mixed tetramers with EcoSSB (Fig. 6, lanes 2                  <br /> and 4). However, fusion of the EcoSSB C-terminal region to                         <br /> HsmtSSB does not impair heterotetramer formation between                          <br /> HsmtSSB and HsEcSSB (Fig. 6, lane 7). All these results show                       <br /> that subunit interaction is restricted to the N-terminal DNA                       <br /> binding domain. However, the N-terminal domains of procaryotic                       <br /> and eucaryotic mitochondrial SSB proteins are too different to                      <br /> allow subunit interaction.                                                          <br />                                                                                     <br /> The C-terminal third of EcoSSB is neither essential for the                        <br /> binding of nucleic acids nor for tetramer formation. The negative                <br /> charges of the last 10 amino acids weaken the binding of the                     <br /> protein to nucleic acids. The electrostatic repulsion depends on                <br /> the distance of these charges from the N-terminal binding domain               <br /> in the amino acid sequence.                                                     <br />                                                                             <br />   However, the last 10 amino acids of the C-terminal third are                    <br /> essential for in vivo function. Mutant SSB proteins missing this               <br /> acidic region are not functional in the E.coli cell. The vital role of    <br /> these last 10 amino acids must be some function different from                    <br /> DNA binding, probably in protein&#226;&#8364;&#8220;protein interactions. The                      <br />                                                                                    <br /> sequence between the DNA binding domain and the last 10 amino                   <br /> acids serves only as a spacer keeping the negative charges away                 <br /> from the bound DNA.                                                                <br />   DNA binding and tetramer formation are both localized in the                  <br /> N-terminal domain. Structural differences in this domain between                 <br /> eucaryotic mitochondrial and procaryotic SSB proteins prohibit          <br /> interactions of the heterologous subunits.
