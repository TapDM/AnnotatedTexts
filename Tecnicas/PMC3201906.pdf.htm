about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> different conditions, namely oxidative stress imposed by <br />      immune cells. <br />  <br />      Aims and Methodology: In this study, we evaluated the role of alternative oxidase (AOX), an enzyme involved in the <br />      intracellular redox balancing, during host-P. brasiliensis interaction. We generated a mitotically stable P. brasiliensis AOX <br />      (PbAOX) antisense RNA (aRNA) strain with a 70% reduction in gene expression. We evaluated the relevance of PbAOX during <br />      interaction of conidia and yeast cells with IFN-c activated alveolar macrophages and in a mouse model of infection. <br />      Additionally, we determined the fungal cell&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s viability and PbAOX in the presence of H2O2. <br />  <br />      Results: Interaction with IFN-c activated alveolar macrophages induced higher levels of PbAOX gene expression in PbWt <br />      conidia than PbWt yeast cells. PbAOX-aRNA conidia and yeast cells had decreased viability after interaction with <br />      macrophages. Moreover, in a mouse model of infection, we showed that absence of wild-type levels of PbAOX in P. <br />      brasiliensis results in a reduced fungal burden in lungs at weeks 8 and 24 post-challenge and an increased survival rate. In <br />      the presence of H2O2, we observed that PbWt yeast cells increased PbAOX expression and presented a higher viability in <br />      comparison with PbAOX-aRNA yeast cells. <br />  <br />      Conclusions: These data further support the hypothesis that PbAOX is important in the fungal defense against oxidative <br />      stress imposed by immune cells and is relevant in the virulence of P. brasiliensis. <br />  <br />  <br /> Introduction                                                                              H2O2 to H2O [6]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that <br />                                                                                           Aspergillus fumigatus produces an alternative oxidase (AOX) that <br />    An essential event during cell growth and host invasion of                             contributes to both reduction of ROS generated by mitochondria <br /> pathogenic fungi is to avoid the toxic effects of reactive oxygen                         and regulation of energy production and metabolism [7]. <br /> species (ROS), such as superoxide (O2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)                          Recently, Magnani et al (2007) suggested that AOX is required <br /> and hydroxyl (OH2) radicals.
