In vertebrate systems, isoprene- <br />                                           based retinoid and steroid hormones each have been shown to affect embryonic <br />                                           development and reproductive maturation (Daftary and Taylor, 2006). <br />  <br />                                           In the case of retinoids, several independent experimental paradigms to manipulate either the <br />                                           ligand, or its receptor, similarly support a role of endogenous retinoid in embryonic tissue <br />                                           differentiation. First, application of exogenous retinoic acid induces clear teratogenic effects <br />                                           on the embryonic formation of limbs and the central nervous system (Collins and Mao, <br />                                           1999). Second, elegant surgical explantion techniques to detect secretion of biologically <br />                                           active retinoid (Sonneveld et al. ,1998) have supported the hypothesis of an endogenous <br />                                           paracrine contribution of retinoic acid (Maden, 2001). Third, confirmatory morphogenetic <br />                                           outcomes were observed when molecular genetics was used to block endogenous retinoid <br />                                           biosynthesis by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Ji et al., 2006). <span id='am-2' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>From</span> the other direction of <br />                                           experimental paradigm, i.e., manipulation of the ligand&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s receptor, molecular genetics to <br />                                           remove the retinoic acid receptor again supported a model of paracrine activation of the <br />                                           retinoic acid receptor to regulate embryonic differentiation (Maden, 2006). <br />  <br />                                           A similar line of investigation has been used in Drosophila melanogaster (hereafter: <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           Drosophila) and other invertebrate model systems, to test the role of steroid and isoprene- <br />                                           derived farnesoid hormones in insect embryonic development and tissue differentiation. <br />                                           These farnesoid hormones are synthesized in a pathway that involves 3-Hydroxy-3- <br />                                           Methylglutaryl CoA Reductase (HMGCR, Belles et al. 2005). Classical endocrine organ <br />                                           (ring gland) transplantation experiments evidenced that a hormone (that was later identified <br />                                           as 20-hydroxy ecdysone; 20E) was necessary for both larval molting and to drive the <br />                                           maturation of imaginal discs at the end of larval development (Bodenstein, 1944; Jones and <br />                                           Jones, 2007Vogt, 1943;). Molecular genetic experiments in Drosophila to block enzymes in <br />                                           the 20E biosynthetic pathway yielded early death of larvae (Henrich et al., 1993). Similarly, <br />                                           when biosynthesis of 20E was conditionally blocked during the metamorphic third larval <br />                                           instar, morphogenetic derangement of certain nerves and of imaginal structures was <br />                                           observed (Brennan et al., 1998; Li and Cooper, 2001).

On the basis of studies in other surgically <br />                                           tractable model insects, the first known farnesoid hormone in Drosophila (methyl <br />                                           epoxyfarnesoate, JH III) was hypothesized to function in metamorphosis by way of its <br />                                           decrease or absence at metamorphosis (Gilbert et al., 2000). Indeed, morphogenetic <br />                                           derangements can be obtained by exogenous JH treatment of Drosophila larvae at the onset <br />                                           of the larval to pupal transition (Postelthwait, 1974; Riddiford and Ashburner, 1991; <br />                                           Wozniak et al., 2004). However, for reasons of the small size of Drosophila larvae and the <br />                                           surgical difficulty in excising the juvenile hormone secreting cells from the ring gland, the <br />                                           corresponding experiment to surgically remove the endogenous hormone could not be done. <br />  <br />                                           Experimental dissection later became more complicated by the discovery that the endocrine <br />                                           source secretes not one, but three farnesoids: methyl farnesoate, methyl epoxyfarnesoate (= <br />                                           JH III), and methyl bisepoxyfarnesoate (Richard et al., 1989a; hereafter referred to as <br />                                           &#226;&#8364;&#732;farnesoid hormones&#226;&#8364;&#8482; or &#226;&#8364;&#732;methyl farnesoids&#226;&#8364;&#8482;).

                  &#226;&#8364;&#339;ultraspiracle&#226;&#8364;&#65533; phenotype, most null mutant larvae for MET survive to adulthood (Wilson et <br />                                              al., 2006). Hence, the actual role of farnesoid hormones in the larval development and <br />                                              metamorphosis of Drosophila remains inadequately understood. <br />  <br />                                              In the present study, we have used RNAi molecular genetic approaches targeted to the ring <br />                                              gland to selectively block the endogenous biosynthesis of the three methyl farnesoids <br />                                              secreted by the Drosophila ring gland. We report here the resultant survival, behavioral, <br />                                              morphogenetic and other phenotypic outcomes. These outcomes include the presentation of <br />                                              an apparent&#226;&#8364;&#339;ultraspiracle&#226;&#8364;&#65533; death phenotype, similar to that exhibited by larvae carrying a <br />                                              null mutation for the Drosophila RXR. The death with &#226;&#8364;&#339;ultraspiracle&#226;&#8364;&#65533; phenotype can be <br />                                              rescued by exogenously supplying a dedicated endogenous farnesoid precursor to the three <br />                                              secreted farnesoid hormones. <br />  <br />                                Methods and Materials <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                Fly Strains <br />                                              The fly strains used in these studies were maintained on standard food medium at 25&#194;&#176; C. The <br />                                              wildtype background used in the present study was the yellow white (yw) strain. In order to <br />                                              accomplish reduction in expression of the enzyme 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl CoA <br />                                              Reductase (HMGCR) specifically in the corpora allatal cells, a binary UAS-based system <br />                                              was used. The fly line used here (Di11) carrying the transgene with a promoter for <br />                                              expression of the Gal4 protein specifically in the corpora allata cells was characterized <br />                                              previously (Belgacem and Martin, 2007). The specificity of the expression of this RNAi <br />                                              only in the corpora allatal cells ensures that the HMGCR-dependent pathways in all other <br />                                              larval body tissues (which lead to products other than methyl farnesoid hormones) are left <br />                                              unsuppressed by the RNAi. Hence, the phenotypic outcomes observed will be arising <br />                                              specifically from suppressing the HMGCR-dependent pathway of the corpora allatal cells <br />                                              that leads to the production by those cells of the three methyl farnesoid hormones. From a <br />                                              fly strain (10367-R3) previously reported as transformed with a UAS-driven transgene <br />                                              encoding expression of RNAi against HMGCR (p[UAS-RNAi-HMGCR] (a courtesy of R. <br />                                              Ueda, NIG, Japan, to J.R.M.) (Belgacem and Martin, 2007)) we recovered upon outcrossing <br />                                              to yw two independent transformant lines. Both lines performed similarly upon crossing into <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                              a background containing the Di11 transgene (the latter characterized by Belgacem and <br />                                              Martin 2007), so the results with only one of these (HMGR(r)) are reported here. The Di11 <br />                                              transgenic chromosome is homozygous lethal, but can be maintained over a chromosome 3 <br />                                              Ser balancer marked with an actin-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP). For subsequent <br />                                              collection of hemolymph samples and hormone treatment experiments, these flies were <br />                                              crossed to the strain homozygous for the HMGCR expression transgene. At the time of <br />                                              collection of newly hatched 1st instar larvae, those larvae visually expressing GFP under <br />                                              proper illumination were manually removed. <br />  <br />                                Experimental Rearing Conditions <br />                                              Newly hatching 1st instar larvae (&lt; 4 hr old) were collected and reared individually at 25&#194;&#176; C <br />                                              in 10 mm &#195;&#8212; 75 mm glass vials containing standard Drosophila diet.

Each replicate <br />                                             consisted of at least 11 larvae being reared individually in glass vials of food, onto which <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             had been layered and dried 6.25 &#206;&#188;l of an ethanolic solution containing 125 nanomoles of the <br />                                             given compound. Each larva was examined daily for the following parameters (a) the <br />                                             developmental stage of death, (b) the status of ecdysis before death, (c) the location of the <br />                                             body at death (in the food, on the food, on the glass wall of the vial or at the interface of the <br />                                             food and the glass wall) and (d) for the location of the ecdysed prior instar larval mouthparts <br />                                             (whether attached to the dead larva, visibly separated or not from the dead larvae by more <br />                                             than one body <span id='am-3' about='xsp:length' typeof='owl:Thing'>length</span> away, or not present on either the food or the wall of the glass vial, i.e., <br />                                             located down in the food). When the larva died on the glass wall of the vial, it could be <br />                                             easily determined whether the caste prior cuticle was still attached to the new body. This <br />                                             status could also be observationally determined when the new larva had died on the food. <br />                                             However, in a minority of cases, the roughened/wet food surface prevented clear <br />                                             observation of the point of attachment. On the basis of some preliminary assessments, we <br />                                             decided that for the purpose of the studies here, it was reasonable to presume that <br />                                             mouthparts less than one body length away from the body of the dead larva were still <br />                                             attached to the larva. <br />  <br />                                             For the studies on hemolymph farnesoid concentrations, wild type and experimental 3rd <br />                                             instar larvae were reared as respective batch cohorts on standard diet, and recovered from <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                             the diet for extraction at the time indicated in the text. Some parallel experimental larvae <br />                                             were reared on food containing blue dye, which confirmed the larvae were feeding during <br />                                             the 3rd instar up to the time of collection. <br />  <br />                                Microscopy <br />                                             Photography of phenotypes relating to failed partial ecdysis, arrested puparial/pupal <br />                                             development and melanization of the tracheal system was performed with a Spot camera <br />                                             (Nikon) on a Nikon SMZ1500 binocular microscope.

According to the known <br />                                             biosynthesis pathway for each of these compounds in Drosophila, all three derive from <br />                                             mevalonate, the enzymatic product of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (Belles et al., <br />                                             2005; Moshitsky and Applebaum, 1995).

To confirm by physiochemical means that the methyl farnesoid <br />                                           concentration in circulation is suppressed, we measured the methyl farnesoid concentration <br />                                           in normally developing and RNAi-targeted larvae. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           Due to constraints in obtaining hemolymph from second instar or younger Drosophila <br />                                           larvae, analyses were performed on surviving mid-late 3rd instar RNAi-HMCGR larvae. As <br />                                           a control for potential occasion to occasion differences in developmental rates, on each <br />                                           occasion that a cohort of Di11; RNAi-HMGCR larvae were bled, a sibling cohort of Actin- <br />                                           GFP/RNAi-HMGCR (i.e., wild type) larvae were bled. The ratio between these two groups <br />                                           of the total circulating methyl farnesoids was then calculated. <br />  <br />                                           These cohorts of batch reared larvae were washed several times with distilled water prior to <br />                                           extraction of hemolymph. The hemolymph obtained was by manual piercing of larvae with a <br />                                           fine needle, and then centrifuging (2000 g &#195;&#8212; 2 min) the carcasses against a fine mesh cloth in <br />                                           an 0.5 ml microfuge tube. The isolated hemolymph that had been collected into the bottom <br />                                           of the tube was immediately transferred into methanol in 500 ul conical glass microvials <br />                                           having Teflon crimp caps for subsequent determination of methyl farnesoid content. <br />  <br />                                           As adapted from Teal et al. (2000), methyl farnesoids were extracted from methanolic <br />                                           extracts of hemolymph by injecting 100 &#206;&#188;l of pentane containing 1pg/ul each of Z-9- <br />                                           tetradecenoic acid methyl ester (Z-9-14:OMe) and farnesyl acetate (FA) through the cap of <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           the vial and then vortexing the mixture for 2min. The emulsification was broken by <br />                                           centrifugation at 8000 g for 5 min and the pentane layer removed to a new vial. The <br />                                           methanolic extract was re-extracted using only pentane (100 &#206;&#188;l) two additional times and the <br />                                           pentane extracts combined. Prior to chemical analysis the samples were subjected to micro- <br />                                           solid phase extraction (MSPE). MSPE was performed using 3.5 mm (id) glass tubes drawn <br />                                           to a 1.5 mm (id) hole.

Prior to application of extracts the MSPE was washed with 2ml of <br />                                           pentane. After application of the pentane extract from hemolymph the MSPE was washed <br />                                           with another 500 &#206;&#188;l of pentane. The farnesoids of interest were then eluted with 250 &#206;&#188;l of <br />                                           pentane containing 15% redistilled ethyl acetate. Samples were concentrated to ca.15 &#206;&#188;l <br />                                           under a fine stream of N2 prior to chemical analysis. <br />  <br />                                           Chemical ionization mass spectroscopy (CIMS, isobutene reagent gas) was performed using <br />                                           an Agilent 5975B MS interfaced to an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (GC). Samples <br />                                           (1ul) were injected using a cool-on-column injector. The injector was fitted with a 10 cm <br />                                           length of 0.5 mm (internal diameter) deactivated fused silica tubing which was in-turn <br />                                           connected to a 1m &#195;&#8212; 0. 25 mm ( internal diameter) length of deactivated fused silica tubing <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           which acted as a retention gap. The retention gap was connected to the analytical column, a <br />                                           30m &#195;&#8212; 0.25 mm (id, 0.25 &#206;&#188;m coating thickness) DB5MS (J&amp;W Scientific) fused silica <br />                                           capillary column.

The MS was operated in selective ion mode (SIM) using m/z = 241 for <br />                                           methyl (Z)-9-tetradecenoate (Z-9-14:OME); m/z = 251, 219, 191 for methyl farnesoate; m/z <br />                                           = 267, 249 and 235 for methyl epoxyfarnesoate); m/z = 221 and 203 for farnesyl acetate <br />                                           (FA); m/z = 283, 265 and 251 for methyl bisepoxyfarnesoate). <br />  <br />                                           Each day an initial analysis was performed using a synthetic blend of the compounds of <br />                                           interest at a concentration of 1ng/&#206;&#188;l in the total ion acquisition mode (m/z 60-300) to <br />                                           determine the retention times and chromatographic properties of the compounds. If <br />                                           properties had changed we replaced the retention gaps and reanalyzed the standard blend.

We sought to determine 2nd instar, 3rd instar, and pupal phenotypic <br />                                           outcomes of RNAi interference with HMGCR. We first sought to determine the periods of <br />                                           lethal phenotype in these &#226;&#8364;&#339;farnesoid (-)&#226;&#8364;&#65533; animals. To ensure that the time of death was <br />                                           accurately determined, the larvae were individually reared and monitored regularly during <br />                                           the ensuing larval feeding and molting. As shown in Fig. 1, we observed specific <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           physiological occasions at which larval death was concentrated. The major periods of larval <br />                                           death were at each occasion of larval molting, i.e., during or newly after the 1st to 2nd instar <br />                                           molt, during or newly after the 2nd to 3rd instar molt and, of those still surviving, finally at <br />                                           puparium formation or the larval-pupal molt. The greatest mortality was observed at or <br />                                           immediately after the 2nd to 3rd instar molt (&#226;&#8364;&#339;L2-3 intramolt&#226;&#8364;&#65533; and &#226;&#8364;&#339;NM3&#226;&#8364;&#65533; = newly molted <br />                                           3rd instar in Fig. 1). Observations in which blue dye was included in the food confirmed that <br />                                           the larvae were feeding during the 1st and 2nd instar prior to their death at the intramolt <br />                                           periods. <br />  <br />                                Suppressed Methyl Farnesoid Level in Hemolymph of RNAi-HMGCR Larvae <br />                                           In view of the strong larval death phenotype observed in larvae expressing RNAi-HMGCR, <br />                                           we sought confirmation that the level circulating farnesoid hormone was reduced. The <br />                                           complex and potentially shifting ratio of the three methyl farnesoids secreted by the ring <br />                                           gland (methyl farnesoate, methyl epoxyfarnesoate, methyl bisepoxyfarnesoate) at different <br />                                           stages of Drosophila larval development is not known. Hence our genetic approach here was <br />                                           to suppress production of all three methyl farnesoids. Due to constraints on obtaining <br />                                           sufficient hemolymph to measure circulating total methyl farnesoid concentration in 2nd <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           instar larvae, we sampled hemolymph from RNAi-HMGCR larvae that had survived to the <br />                                           mid-late 3rd instar feeding stage. For each sampling occasion, a matched cohort of wild type <br />                                           larvae was also bled, and the ratio of the measurements from the two groups was calculated. <br />                                           For n=3 matched pairs of cohorts, the average&#194;&#177;SE of ratio of total methyl farnesoid <br />                                           concentration in RNAi-HMGCR to wild type was 0.37&#194;&#177; 0.06 (i.e., was significantly reduced <br />                                           to 37% of the concentration (1.7 nanomolar) in the wild type 3rd instar larvae, P &lt; 0.006, t- <br />                                           statistic). These ratio data support that the RNAi-interference method we used was <br />                                           successful in suppressing the level of circulating methyl farnesoid hormone. Because we <br />                                           analysed the experimental hormone levels only in those rare RNAi-HMGCR larvae that <br />                                           survived to the mid-late 3rd instar, it is likely that the ratio above underestimates the level of <br />                                           farnesoid suppression during larval development.

As seen in Fig. 2 A, in this phenotype, the <br />                                            apolysed 2nd instar posterior spiracles are juxtaposed near the prior 1st instar posterior <br />                                            spiracles. A similar apolysed state is seen on the anterior end of the larva, with the 2nd instar <br />                                            mouthparts juxtaposed near the prior 1st instar mouthparts (Fig. 2 B). The same spiracular <br />                                            and mouthpart phenotypes were observed for larvae which survived the first larval molt, but <br />                                            instead died at the next (2nd to 3rd) instar molt (Fig. 2 C). <br />  <br />                                            At each larval-larval molt, some other larvae progressed slightly beyond the unecdysed <br />                                            &#226;&#8364;&#339;ultraspiracle&#226;&#8364;&#65533; phenotype, and attained an incomplete ecdysis before dying. Examples in <br />                                            Fig. 3 show larvae attempting to ecdyse from the 2nd to the 3rd instar. Some larvae could <br />                                            only split the apolysed 2nd instar cuticle along the middle of the body, and not remove the <br />                                            remainder of the cuticle from either the mouthparts or the posterior end (Fig. 3A). In other <br />                                            cases, the 2nd instar cuticle was fully ecdysed except for being caught on the mouthparts <br />                                            (Fig. 3B). In other (the majority of) cases the mouthparts were freed, but the old cuticle <br />                                            remained caught only on the posterior end and was dragged along as the dying larva <br />                                            attempted to move (Fig. 3C). <br />  <br />                                Death at Larval-Pupal Molt <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            Less than 5% of the individually reared farnesoid (-) larvae survived to pupariation. Some of <br />                                            these larvae became developmentally arrested at pupariation stage with variation in <br />                                            phenotype. Most that were arrested stopped development after sclerotization of the <br />                                            puparium but prior to eversion to the white pupa stage (Fig. 4A, B). However, a minor <br />                                            proportion were observed that ceased feeding, became sessile, everted their anterior <br />                                            spiracles, but then failed to sclerotize a puparium. A trend was also observed that the smaller <br />                                            the size of the sclerotized puparium that was formed, the lesser was the browning <br />                                            pigmentation of the puparium. <br />  <br />                                Abnormal Morphology of Puparium <br />                                            Normally, when the body of the 3rd instar larva contracts to form the puparium, the anterior <br />                                            spiracles are everted, with the ends of each everted spiracle possessing papillae that splay <br />                                            apart (Fig. 4 D). However, many animals expressing the HMCGR-RNAi that exhibited <br />                                            arrested puparial development also frequently failed to fully spread the projected ends of the <br />                                            everted anterior spiracles (Fig. 4 E). In a series of animals examined for this purpose, <br />                                            significantly fewer (14%, n = 64) of the HMGCR-RNAi expressing animals showed the <br />                                            normal splaying of the papillae on both everted spiracles, as compared to 94.7% of sibling <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            GFP-expressing animals (n=21) (P &lt; 0.001, &#207;&#8225;2 test). In the farnesoid (-) larvae that were <br />                                            developmentally arrested as puparia, the operculum often was misformed and not fully <br />                                            contracted anteriorly/posteriorly (Fig. 4 G). <br />  <br />                                Death During Pupal and Adult Stages <br />                                            Of the small percentage of larvae that attained an apparently normally externally formed <br />                                            white pupa stage, some did not proceed beyond that stage, while others developed on to the <br />                                            pharate adult before arresting development. No animals were observed that appeared to have <br />                                            clearly ceased development between the white pupa and the pharate adult stage (e.g., <br />                                            reaching eye pigmentation but not progressing farther). Few animals (mostly females) <br />                                            survived to adult emergence (Fig. 1). Of those that did, individuals expressing a particular <br />                                            tracheal melanization phenotype appeared to survive a shorter time than other surviving <br />                                            siblings (see below). <br />  <br />  <br />                                            Gen Comp Endocrinol.

In view of a previous report that the <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            total time from egg hatch to pupation was increased in farnesoid (-) larvae (Belgacem and <br />                                            Martin 2007), we inquired as to what stages during that interval were being lengthened. <br />                                            Close observation disclosed that farnesoid (-) larvae attained the molt from the 2nd to the 3rd <br />                                            instar at most several hours later than sibling larvae not expressing the RNAi (within the <br />                                            margin of &#194;&#177; 2 hr time of collection of that starting newly hatched 1st instar larvae). We then <br />                                            observed that larvae surviving beyond that the 2nd to 3rd larval molt showed a sharp <br />                                            dichotomy into two groups with respect to the subsequent rate of development to <br />                                            pupariation. Under the rearing conditions we used, most control sibling 3rd instar larvae not <br />                                            expressing RNAi against HMGCR(r) took 2-3 more days to then develop to pupariation. <br />                                            The subset of farnesoid (-) larvae that successfully formed white pupae also took 2-3 days to <br />                                            develop to puparation after the 2nd to 3rd instar molt. However, the total larvae period up to <br />                                            pupariation by the other subset of farnesoid (-) larvae that became developmentally arrested <br />                                            at puparium formation was delayed by a day, compared to the subset of farnesoid (-) larvae <br />                                            that proceeded on to the white pupa stage (avg.&#194;&#177; S.E. 6.3&#194;&#177;0.21 days versus 5.3&#194;&#177;.07 days, <br />                                            respectively, p &lt; 0.01, t-statistic). Hence, the general appearance of a delay in larval <br />                                            development of farnesoid(-) animals centered primarily in a lengthed 3rd instar in the subset <br />                                            of animals that attained, but then developmentally arrested at, puparium formation. <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            Although these larvae that became developmentally arrested at pupariation exhibited a 3rd <br />                                            instar feeding period an average of a day longer than normal, this did not result in greater <br />                                            final size of the larva. As shown in Fig. 4A, B such puparial larvae instead were typically <br />                                            distinctly smaller in size than normal. <br />  <br />                                Behavioral Changes in Farnesoid (-) Larvae <br />                                            Under the conditions of rearing larvae individually in small glass vials, nearly all control <br />                                            sibling larvae not expressing the RNAi pupated at the surface of the food, typically at the <br />                                            interface of the edge of the food and the glass vial (Fig. 5). However, farnesoid (-) larvae <br />                                            exhibited a distinctly different behavior. Beginning with those that died at the 1st to 2nd <br />                                            instar molt, some of these larvae moved up the side of the glass vial before they died at that <br />                                            location. Surviving larvae that went on to attain the 2nd to 3rd instar intramolt, or even to the <br />                                            newly molted 3rd instar, respectively, as their stage of death, exhibited a significantly <br />                                            increased tendency to move up the side of the glass vial before they died on the glass (Fig. <br />                                            5). <br />  <br />                                            The above data prompted an even closer observation regime to detect the actual movement <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            that preceded death on the side of the glass rearing vial. On several occasions we observed <br />                                            that newly molted 3rd instar larvae would suddenly and quickly move from the food to the <br />                                            side of the vial, and within a very short time of aggressive move many (&gt;10) body lengths <br />                                            up the side of the vial away from the food. At some point, the movement would change to <br />                                            moving laterally along the vial, and the larva would soon cease moving, and subsequently <br />                                            engage in feeble movements. Within several hours the larva would be dead, often not having <br />                                            moved far (e.g., less than 2-3 body lengths), though sometimes the larva would be found <br />                                            back down on the food, dead or moribund. <br />  <br />                                            In other cases, farnesoid (-) larvae were observed at the 2nd to 3rd instar intramolt stage that <br />                                            would similarly move quickly up the side of the vial. A signature behavior of these larvae <br />                                            would be to rear their head and first several body segments up off the glass, &#226;&#8364;&#732;cobra-like&#226;&#8364;&#8482;. <br />                                            The larvae would appear to be exerting considerable strain and tension within the body <br />                                            (giving the impression that the larvae were trying to ecdyse).

Thus, <br />                                            when the biosynthetic pathway leading to all three naturally secreted methyl farnesoids is <br />                                            suppressed, adding only one of the farnesoids (JH III or methyl farnesoate) back to the larva <br />                                            is even more developmentally adverse than is the case of just suppression of the biosynthetic <br />                                            pathway. <br />  <br />                                            The newly molted 3rd instar larvae that died in the EtOH carrier treated controls exhibited a <br />                                            distinct phenotype in which 2nd instar cuticle, although nearly fully ecdysed, most often <br />                                            remained attached at a narrow point to the body of the new 3rd instar. Most commonly the <br />                                            point of remaining attachment was at the posterior spiracles (e.g., Fig. 3 C). However, <br />                                            farnesol, a dedicated precursor to the synthesis of all three methyl farnesoids normally <br />                                            secreted by the ring glands (Belles et al., 2005), exerted a rescue effect. Nearly all farnesol <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            treated larvae were rescued to fully ecdyse and release the second instar cuticle. An <br />                                            additional phenotype of rescue by farnesol was also observed. When individually reared <br />                                            wild type 2nd instar larvae ecdyse to the 3rd instar, the ecdysis typically takes place under the <br />                                            food surface, so that the case 2nd instar mouthparts cannot be observed by external <br />                                            examination of the vial and food. The farnesol-treated farnesoid (-) larvae not only fully <br />                                            ecdysed the 2nd instar cuticle, but they also did so under the food surface. Thus, the <br />                                            inclusion of farnesol in the diet (1) rescued the larval molting biochemistry to enable full <br />                                            ecdysis of the 2nd instar cuticle, and (2) rescued the wild type behavior to conduct that <br />                                            ecdysis under the food surface. <br />  <br />                                Melanization of Tracheal System <br />                                            The larvae expressing RNAi against HMGCR exhibited a striking and fully penetrant <br />                                            phenotype of melanization of the tracheal system, especially the two main dorsal tracheal <br />                                            trunks (Fig. 7). This phenotype most often began at the posterior end of the two main dorsal <br />                                            tracheae (Fig. 7 B, arrow), becoming apparent at the approach or onset of the 2nd to 3rd <br />                                            larval molt. However, in a minority of larvae, the phenotype would begin earlier, during the <br />                                            feeding stage of the 2nd instar, as one or several small black dots at the posterior end of the <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            larva. Only in very rare cases did a 2nd instar feeding larva that exhibited these spots then <br />                                            fail to proceed on to body-wide manifestation of the melanization shown in Fig. 7 A-C. <br />  <br />                                            Once the 2nd to 3rd instar larval molt had been reached, the melanization spread anteriorly <br />                                            up each tracheal trunk over the next several hours. During this anterior spread, the <span id='am-395' about='xsp:pattern' typeof='owl:Thing'>pattern</span> in <br />                                            many larvae would pass through a phase in which the melanization first seemed localized to <br />                                            periodically distributed foci, often paralleling each other on each tracheal trunk (Fig. 7 A). <br />                                            The melanization would then spread to the intervening areas of the tracheal trunks, making a <br />                                            pair of continguous stripes anteriorly up the body of the larva (Fig. 7 B, C). <br />  <br />                                            The great majority of RNAi-expressing larvae that exhibited these melanization stripes <br />                                            would become moribund within several hours of the 2nd to 3rd instar molt. However, a very <br />                                            small percentage would attain pupariation (Fig. 4 A, B), and an even smaller proportion <br />                                            would reach pupation.

We report here a <br />                                            number of morphogenetic abnormalities that appear to represent misfunction of the <br />                                            metamorphic endocrine axes. Some of these abnormalities could be rescued by exogenous <br />                                            treatment with a farnesoid that is a dedicated precursor to the three methyl farnesoid <br />                                            compounds normally secreted from the larval ring gland. <br />  <br />                                &#226;&#8364;&#339;Ultraspiracle&#226;&#8364;&#65533; Phenotype <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            It is well established that larval molting and metamorphosis in Drosophila is <br />                                            endocrinologically regulated, with the indispensible participation of two heterodimerizing <br />                                            nuclear hormone receptors: the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and &#226;&#8364;&#339;ultraspiracle&#226;&#8364;&#65533;(USP) (Henrich, <br />                                            2005). Genetic experiments to test specifically for the phenotype that occurs when either <br />                                            EcR or USP is missing during larval development have yielded respectively similar results. <br />  <br />                                            Originally, USP was named on the basis of a phenotype of lethal failed ecdysis at the 1st to <br />                                            2nd instar molt, wherein unecdysing larvae retain the 1st instar posterior spiracles juxtaposed <br />                                            near the underlying 2nd instar spiracles (Perrimon et al., 1985). Null mutants for USP also <br />                                            exhibit failure to ecdyse the 1st instar mouthparts, resulting in juxtaposition of the 1st and 2nd <br />                                            instar mouthparts (i.e., &#226;&#8364;&#339;double mouthparts,&#226;&#8364;&#65533; Li and Bender, 2000). Tests for the effect of <br />                                            loss of larval EcR function yielded a similar double spiracle/double mouthparts phenotype at <br />                                            either of the first two larval instars (Li and Bender, 2000). These similarities in loss of larval <br />                                            function phenotypes for both USP and the EcR support the model that both receptors are <br />                                            necessary components of their heterodimer for the purposes of passage through the first two <br />                                            larval molts, perhaps as part of a larger complex containing the methoprene-tolerant (MET) <br />                                            protein and other transcription factors (Bitra and Palli, 2009; Li et al., 2007). <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            While the above &#226;&#8364;&#732;joint phenotypes&#226;&#8364;&#8482; support a model of the joint necessity of each receptor in <br />                                            larval molting, there remains the consideration as to the necessity, joint or otherwise, of <br />                                            respective ligands of the two receptors. Classical in vivo endocrine transplantation studies of <br />                                            Bodenstein (1944) showed that larval cuticle deprived of endocrine product of the ring gland <br />                                            (a major source of larval ecdysone, the precursor to 20-OH ecdysone) fails to molt, but that <br />                                            restoration of that endocrine source restores the larval molt. In a later genetic approach, <br />                                            some mutations that rendered deficiency in 20-OH ecdysone, (the ligand for EcR) also <br />                                            rendered the phenotypes the double mouthhooks (Gaziova et al., 1994; Henrich et al., 1993) <br />                                            and double spiracles (Henrich, pers. comm.) at the failed larval-larval ecdysis. <br />  <br />                                            In the present study, we report that many larvae with suppressed ring gland production of all <br />                                            three of the known secreted methyl farnesoid products also exhibit a double mouthpart/ <br />                                            double spiracle phenotype. Distinctively, Henrich et al.

These results are significant in that at least one of these methyl <br />                                            farnesoids in physical assay can bind the receptor USP with nanomolar affinity (ca. 50 nM, <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            Jones et al. 2006). Hence, under certain conditions, this same &#226;&#8364;&#339;ultraspiracle&#226;&#8364;&#65533; (failed ecdysis) <br />                                            phenotype is exhibited by larvae that are (1) suppressed for expression of either of the two <br />                                            heterodimerizing hormone receptors, or (2) suppressed for either endogenous circulating <br />                                            compounds that exhibit nanomolar affinity in physical assay for the two respective <br />                                            receptors.

The compound farnesol is a product in <br />                                            the endogenous pathway that leads from HMGCR to biosynthesis, in the ring gland, of the <br />                                            three secreted methyl farnesoids. Because farnesol is &#226;&#8364;&#732;dedicated&#226;&#8364;&#8482; to the production of methyl <br />                                            farnesoids, reduced farnesol production in turn results in reduced production of the three <br />                                            downstream methyl farnesoid hormones. The present study found that the &#226;&#8364;&#339;ultraspiracle&#226;&#8364;&#65533; <br />                                            phenotype of failed L2-3 ecdysis (that occurs when the farnesoid pathway in the ring gland <br />                                            is blocked) can be rescued by topical/dietary provision of farnesol. So far as we are aware, <br />                                            these results are the first report that any failed larval-larval molting process in Drosophila <br />                                            can be rescued to successful ecdysis by provision of exogenous farnesoid. Because farnesol <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            is a pathway component that is upstream of the steps yielding the three secreted methyl <br />                                            farnesoid hormones, if the exogenously supplied farnesol rescues the remaining downstream <br />                                            biosynthetic steps, it would be predicted to rescue the production of all three secreted methyl <br />                                            farnesoid hormones. <br />  <br />                                            An exacerbation of the larval lethal phenotype of suppressed farnesoid production was seen <br />                                            when individual methyl farnesoid hormones (methyl farnesoate or JH III) were supplied <br />                                            exogenously to farnesoid (-) larvae. This may at first seem paradoxical &#226;&#8364;&#8220; provision of <br />                                            missing farnesoid hormone might be hypothesized to rescue, not exacerbate, the lethal <br />                                            phenotype. One possible explanation could be that a proper total concentration and proper <br />                                            ratio of all three secreted farnesoid hormones is necessary to effectuate nonredundant larval <br />                                            functions of these three hormones. A detailed titering of the circulating concentrations of <br />                                            these three hormones during larval development is urgently needed. <br />  <br />                                Misformation of Puparium <br />                                            An endocrine-regulated morphogenetic feature of the Drosophila metamorphosis is the <br />                                            formation of a puparium from the 3rd instar cuticle. The shape of the puparium arises, in <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            part, from a contraction of the larval body after it has ceased feeding and attached itself to <br />                                            substrate. Classical endocrine transplantation studies of Vogt (1943) and Possompes (1953) <br />                                            demonstrated that surgical interference with normal ring gland secretory function during the <br />                                            3rd instar can result in failure of the larval body to contract into its more compact puparial <br />                                            shape, especially anteriorly. More recent genetic analysis of mutant nuclear hormone <br />                                            receptors implicated a mechanistic role in this phenotype for the ligand binding domain of <br />                                            USP (Henrich et al., 2000). Indeed, the morphology of the puparial operculum shown in Fig. <br />                                            4 G here looks very similar to the aberrant puparial operculum obtained by Henrich et al. <br />                                            (2000) with their USP ligand binding domain mutant (see their Fig. 1, that is reproduced in <br />                                            part here as Fig. 4 F). <br />  <br />                                            Relatedly, Vogt (1943) observed that in larvae made farnesoid (-) (by ligation) before <br />                                            commitment to wandering behavior, the isolated abdominal epidermis exhibited a distinct <br />                                            sensitivity to endocrine induction to formation of a puparium.

Subsequent in vitro ring gland culture experiments <br />                                           observed a surge in secretion of all three methyl farnesoid hormones at the end of the third <br />                                           instar, after a pre-wandering commitment to the subsequent wandering behavior (Jones and <br />                                           Jones, 2007; Richards et al., 1989a). That is, the stage of the larval ring gland where the <br />                                           secretion of corpora allatal cells exhibited a puparium-formation activity in bioassay is also <br />                                           a larval stage at which a surge occurs in secretion of methyl farnesoids by cultured glands <br />                                           (and in increase in total circulating methyl farnesoids, data not shown). <br />  <br />                                           These data provide endocrine evidence of a regulatory separation of the commitment for <br />                                           wandering behavior, versus the subsequent and discrete induction of puparium formation. In <br />                                           our study here, larvae genetically made farnesoid (-) also had difficulty in puparium <br />                                           formation (sclerotization and pigmentation). Thus, the results of the present study using <br />                                           molecular genetics complement the indication of earlier endocrine work that a surge in <br />                                           methyl farnesoids after wandering commitment but before pupariation has a role to enhance <br />                                           the puparium-formation signal. <br />  <br />                                Altered Larval Movement <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           In an earlier study using this same HMGCR-RNAi system to suppress methyl farnesoid <br />                                           production, it was observed that farnesoid (-) adults exhibited less walking behavior than <br />                                           normal (Belgacem and Martin, 2007). However, the effect of suppressed farnesoids on larval <br />                                           movement was not examined in that study. Our present study has identified three forms of <br />                                           larval movement that are altered under conditions of suppressed production of methyl <br />                                           farnesoids. <br />  <br />                                           When feeding wild type larvae are stimulated to molt from the 2nd to 3rd larval instar, under <br />                                           our conditions the larvae typically perform cuticle ecdysis under the surface of the food, so <br />                                           that the cast 2nd instar mouthparts are left under the food surface. However, the farnesoid (-) <br />                                           larvae instead exhibited the behavior to perform the 2nd to 3rd instar larval molt above the <br />                                           surface of the food. Interestingly, exogenous exposure of these larvae to farnesol restored <br />                                           the behavior of the larvae to ecdyse under the food surface. <br />  <br />                                           Related to this altered location of the ecdysis to the 3rd larval instar was our observation of <br />                                           an increased activity of larvae to moveup the side of the glass vial at the time of the 2nd to <br />                                           3rd instar ecdysis. This behavior to vigorously walk up the walls of the glass vial at or near <br />                                           the time of the next larval-larval molt (and die rapidly thereafter) was not observed in the <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           wild type sibling controls. This behavior has apparently not been described as a phenotype <br />                                           of suppressed ecdysone ligand or of suppressed ecdysone receptor. <br />  <br />                                           During normal development near the end of the feeding stage, 3rd instar larvae are induced <br />                                           (apparently by 20E) to cease feeding and walk vigorously for hours, until ceasing at the final <br />                                           location for the larval-pupal molt. In mass culture wandering larvae are frequently observed <br />                                           to move up the sides of the rearing chamber and form a puparium up off of the food. We <br />                                           observed here that when reared individually in the glass vials, the final position of wild type <br />                                           puparium formation was nearly always in the food near the food/vial interface . Early <br />                                           endocrine studies showed that in the absence of the ecdysone-producing fragments of the <br />                                           ring gland, feeding 3rd instar larvae never initiated wandering behavior (Burtt 1938; <br />                                           Possompes 1953). The endocrine studies by Possompes (1953) reported that hormonal <br />                                           secretion of the corpora allatal region of the ring gland during the third (last) instar of <br />                                           Calliphora delayed the exhibition of the &#226;&#8364;&#339;wandering&#226;&#8364;&#65533; behavior.

More recently, natural methyl farnesoid hormones and <br />                                            synthetic structural analogs have been reported to prolong the feeding stage of third instar <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            Drosophila larvae (Riddiford and Ashburner 1981). These data have led to a current <br />                                            paradigm that at least during the 3rd (last) larval instar of Drosophila and other <br />                                            cyclorraphous flies, methyl farnesoid secreted by the corpora allatal cells of the ring gland <br />                                            prolongs the feeding stage and delays wandering behavior. <br />  <br />                                            On the basis of physical protein-protein binding interactions, Li et al., (2007) hypothesized <br />                                            that the MET protein (that was reported in physical assay to bind JH III; Miura et al., 2005) <br />                                            itself binds in a protein complex that contains two other receptors: USP (that binds methyl <br />                                            farnesoate, Jones et al., 2006)) and EcR (that binds 20E). Perhaps with implications for the <br />                                            present study is that overexpression of the MET protein (which can also form homodimers, <br />                                            Godlewski et al., 2006) caused 1st instar larvae to notably die on the side of the food vial <br />                                            (Barry et al., 2008). Although it was not reported that the death occurred at the 1st to 2nd <br />                                            instar larval molt per se, the death was reported to occur about 24 hr after egg hatch, which <br />                                            is close to the time when the molt would normally occur. Barry et al. (2008) hypothesized <br />                                            that the observed effects of MET protein overexpression arose by shifting dynamic <br />                                            equilibrium toward MET homodimer formation, which in turn then disrupted the normal <br />                                            function of the USP/EcR/MET complex. Whether the underlying mechanism of the <br />                                            behavioral alterations observed here, or by Barry et al. (2008), represents a precocious <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            induction of wandering behavior per se, or is the outcome of some other independent effect, <br />                                            remains unknown. <br />  <br />                                            A third form of altered locomotory behavior observed in our studies concerns the wandering <br />                                            behavior prior to puparium formation. A number of those farnesoid (-) larvae surviving the <br />                                            molt to the 3rd instar then exhibited a distinct delay in the exhibition of wander behavior. <br />                                            This altered behavior was most associated with those animals that developmentally arrested <br />                                            after formation of the puparium. Both delayed wandering behavior and arrested <br />                                            development at the puparium stage have generally been considered as a symptom of <br />                                            suppressed ecdysteroid action. As reviewed above, there is evidence that the initiation of <br />                                            wandering behavior is modulated by methyl farnesoid secretion from the ring gland during <br />                                            the larval feeding stage. For the subsequent occurrence of puparium formation, it is relevant <br />                                            to consider that Richard et al. (1989a) detected a significant secretion of methyl farnesoids <br />                                            in culture by ring glands that had been excised from animals prior to puparium formation. <br />                                            Collectively the above data warrant the consideration that the delayed wandering behavior <br />                                            and the developmentally arrested puparia observed here both arise indirectly from an effect <br />                                            on the production of 3rd instar ecdysteroids. However, there are binding sites for the USP/ <br />                                            EcR heterodimer at genes such as E75A, that is involved in regulating ecdysone <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                            biosynthesis (Bernado et al., 2009; Bialecki et al., 2002), offering the USP/EcR heterodimer <br />                                            as a possible molecular site of the effect observed here when endogenous farnesoids are <br />                                            suppressed. <br />  <br />                                Tracheal Melanization <br />                                            One of the most striking phenotypes observed in this study was the melanization of the <br />                                            larval tracheal trunks. This melanization typically accelerated in its spread anteriorly in the <br />                                            several hours before death occurred, and further increased after the larvae became moribund/ <br />                                            deceased. This phenotype appears different from the long-known formation of melanotic <br />                                            tumor masses that appear in the hemolymph (rather than the trachea) of larvae receiving <br />                                            pharmacological overdose of farnesoid compounds (Bryant and Sang, 1969). Several lines <br />                                            of evidence suggest that the tracheal melanization phenotype observed here arises from a <br />                                            triggering or release of immune response.

Most of the individually reared <br />                                           larvae expressing an RNAi that blocks expression of HMGCR in the corpora allatal cells <br />                                           were to observed exhibit tracheal melanization. The melanization started at the posterior end <br />                                           of the 2 main dorsal tracheal trunks, and rapidly spread anteriorly at or shortly after the 2nd <br />                                           instar to 3rd instar apolysis (A, B). In some cases, there seemed to be a positional periodicity <br />                                           to foci of the most darkened areas (C). Rarely, larvae that exhibited a lesser amount of <br />                                           melanization survived to pupate, and exhibit melanized streaks in the abdomen (D, E), and <br />                                           even more rarely, those pupae would survive to emerge as adults that still exhibited the <br />                                           tracheal melanization (F). <br /> NIH-PA Author Manuscript <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />                                           Gen Comp Endocrinol.
