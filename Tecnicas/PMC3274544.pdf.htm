increased vulnerability <span id='am-3' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> HS, which was reversed by MB-specific expression of the <br />      caspase inhibitor p35, and similar vulnerability was induced in wild-type flies by knockdown of MB dPGAM5. Elimination of <br />      the MB did not affect the HS response of wild-type flies, but did increase the resistance of dPGAM5-deficient flies to HS. <br />      Thus, the MB may possess an apoptosis-dependent toxic function, the suppression of which by dPGAM5 appears to be <br />      crucial for HS resistance. <br />  <br />  <br /> Introduction                                                                            Phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) is a member of the <br />                                                                                      PGAM family and has been reported to be localized to the <br />    Increases in temperature threaten all living organisms due to                     mitochondria through its N-terminal transmembrane domain [7]. <br /> heat shock (HS) stress. In order to adapt to or resist HS stress, the                PGAM5 has been shown to interact with the anti-apoptotic <br /> cellular expression of a series of HS proteins (HSPs) is induced.                    protein Bcl-xL and the BTB-Kelch substrate adaptor protein <br /> Most of HSPs act as molecular chaperones that prevent protein                        Keap1, which is functional in the Cul3-dependent ubiquitin ligase <br /> aggregation and support proper protein folding [1]. However, cells                   complex [8,9]. It was recently demonstrated that PGAM5 lacks <br /> undergo apoptosis or necrosis when subjected to severe and/or                        authentic PGAM activity but possesses protein phosphatase <br /> prolonged HS stress that exceeds the capacity of the protective HS                   activity highly specific to serine and threonine residues.

The mechanisms of HS-induced apoptosis                        more, it has also been found that, depending on its phosphatase <br /> have been the focus of intense investigation and are generally well                  activity, PGAM5 activates ASK1, the upstream regulator of the <br /> characterized in cultured mammalian cells. For instance, among                       stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP <br /> caspases, caspase-2 and caspase-9 have been proposed to act as                       kinase pathways [10]. More recently, the Drosophila ortholog of <br /> initiator caspases and to mediate HS-induced apoptosis via                           mammalian PGAM5 (dPGAM5) has been shown to act as an <br /> mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization [3,4].
