The same mutations also eliminate autogenous regulation of the HTA1-HTB1 <br />            locus by histones H2A and H2B. The HIR1 and HIR2 genes have been isolated, and their roles in the <br />            transcriptional regulation of the HTA1-HTB1 locus have been characterized. Neither gene encodes an essential <br />            protein, and null alleles derepress HTA1-HTB1 transcription. Both HIR genes are expressed constitutively <br />            under conditions that lead to repression or derepression of the HTAI gene, and neither gene regulates the <br />            expression of the other. The sequence of the HIR1 gene predicts an 88-kDa protein with three repeats of a motif <br />            found in the G. subunit of retinal transducin and in a yeast transcriptional repressor, Tupl. The sequence of <br />            the HIR2 gene predicts a protein of 98 kDa.

These data indicate that the Hirl and                FIG. 8.

The <br />                                                                        hirl strain contained an antigen that reacted with the monoclonal <br /> Hir2 and the observation that a Hir2 protein tagged with the           antibody even in the absence of the HIRl-ha gene.

However, the amino acid sequences of Hirl and                 fructose-6-phosphate kinase (84 kDa), pyruvate kinase (58 kDa), and <br /> Hir2 do not contain any of the common motifs associated                fumarase (48.5 kDa) were included as size standards. <br />  <br /> with DNA binding, and HIRI or HIR2 do not encode one of                    <br /> several proteins that bind to specific sequences in the <br /> HTAI-HTB1 negative site or upstream activating sequence                                          <br /> element (22a). These observations raise the possibility that             <br /> Hirl or Hir2 do not confer repression by directly contacting              <br /> the HTAl-HTB1 promoter and suggest that they may func-                       <br />                                                                            <br /> tion as corepressors to assist a repressor that binds to         <br /> sequences in the negative site. In this regard, it is intriguing          <br /> that the predicted Hirl protein contains three copies of the             <br /> ,B-transducin repeat, a motif found in another transcriptional          <br /> repressor, Tupl (40). Tupl also does not bind directly to              <br /> DNA but has been shown to act with another protein, Ssn6                  <br /> (20, 23, 32), to represses specific groups of genes in response             <br /> to signals which determine either the mating type of the cell                <br /> or the utilization of carbon sources (20, 40). The Tupl/Ssn6        <br /> repressor is apparently targeted to particular promoters by         <br /> its association with additional, site-specific DNA binding                 <br /> proteins.                                                                 <br />    The Ssn6 protein is characterized by another motif, the             <br /> TPR snap helix (13, 20, 35). Goebl and Yanagida have noted               <br /> that many genes encoding TPR proteins are functionally                <br /> related to those encoding ,B-transducin proteins and have                   <br /> suggested that particular pairs of TPR and 1-transducin                <br /> proteins interact to perform a common function (13). In the                 <br /> case of Tupl and Ssn6, whose biochemical (41) and genetic                <br /> (20) interactions have been demonstrated, one such function            <br /> is to act in conjunction with site-specific DNA binding                   <br /> proteins such as a2 and Mcml to repress transcription of               <br /> a-specific genes (20). It is possible that the Hirl protein also          <br /> acts with a TPR class protein to repress transcription of the           <br /> HTA-HBTBI locus by interacting with site-specific DNA                    <br /> binding proteins at the negative site of this locus. While the            <br /> TPR motif is not found in Hir2, it may occur in another Hir               <br /> protein (e.g., Hir3 or Hir4), since a mutation in such a TPR        <br /> class protein would be predicted to confer a Hir- phenotype.          <br /> Alternatively, one of the known TPR proteins of yeasts (e.g.,           <br /> Cdc16, Cdc23, Ski3, Prp6, or Ssn6) may act together with                  <br /> Hirl to regulate HTAl-HTBI transcription; however, muta-               <br /> tions in none of the genes that encode such proteins confer a            <br /> Hir- phenotype (33a).                                                        <br />    Mutations in HIRI and HIR2 produce pleiotropic effects                  <br /> on transcription. In addition to derepressing transcription of           <br /> the HTAJ-HTBI, HHTI-HHFI, and HH72-HHF2 loci, hir                  <br /> mutations affect the transcription of 8 insertion alleles of          <br /> HIS4 and LYS2 by altering the site of transcription initiation            <br /> (34). It is possible that Hirl and Hir2 represent another class          <br /> of general transcriptional repressors that act at diverse yeast         <br /> promoters. However, we have proposed that the effects of                <br /> mutant HIR gene products on transcription of nonhistone            <br /> gene loci are indirect and are mediated by altered chromatin             <br /> structure that results from nonstoichiometric expression of                <br /> the histone gene loci (34). Thus, some mutations that alter            <br /> transcription pleiotropically may not define general tran-                <br /> scriptional regulators but may act primarily by affecting the              <br /> expression of chromatin components such as histones.                       <br /> </body></html>
