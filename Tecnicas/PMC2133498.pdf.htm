It <br /> appears that the plasma can contribute protein readily to body tissues <br /> or body stores, but only in small amounts and with difficulty can the <br /> body contribute protein to the blood plasma--for example in fasting. <br /> T h e t e r m &quot;dynamic equilibrium&quot; has been used to express the ebb <br /> and flow between plasma, organ, and tissue proteins. When reserve <br /> stores are exhausted the blood plasma production depends almost <br /> wholly upon food factors coming into the body <span id='am-3' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> the intestine <br /> (16, 13, 9). <br />   Reserve stores under ordinary conditions are adequate to tide the <br /> body over any emergency call for new formed plasma proteins. A <br /> study of the reserve stores is in progress and it is probable that the <br /> stores of materials from which plasma proteins can be fabricated are <br /> distinct from the stores of hemoglobin building material. <br />    Infection can inhibit the formation of hemoglobin in anemia (17) <br /> and in like fashion it can inhibit the formation of plasma protein <br /> (Tables 3 and 3-a and Chart A below) during plasmapheresis. The <br /> mechanism of this interesting reaction is discussed below. <br />    * We are indebted to Eli Lilly and Company for valuable materials used in <br /> these experiments. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />    A deficiency state which may result fatally can be produced in these <br /> dogs by long continued plasma depletion combined with low protein <br /> intake even when the accessory diet factors, salts and vitamins, are <br /> adequately represented in the diet. It is in a sense an exhaustion of <br /> the protein stores, perhaps an injury of the essential intracellular <br /> protein matrix of the body cells and a disturbance of the protein- <br /> forming mechanism. At any rate, the A / G ratio falls, resistance to <br /> infection is greatly reduced, and the output of new plasma protein <br /> drops to very low levels. <br />    The method of these experiments is simply stated, although not <br /> always simply executed. By daily bleeding and return of washed <br /> red cells suspended in a modified Locke&apos;s solution (plasmapheresis) <br /> the normal plasma protein level in dogs (5 to 7 per cent) is reduced to <br /> about 4 per cent. Here it is maintained fairly constantly over long <br /> periods of time and presumably the hypoproteinemia acts as a strong <br /> stimulus for the regeneration of plasma protein. The protein of the <br /> diet consumed is credited with production of the plasma protein <br /> removed except for the reserve store of plasma protein related to the <br /> previous dietary history and necessarily removed in the initial weeks <br /> before a constant output is displayed. These depleted and standard- <br /> ized dogs then react with considerable uniformity to various proteins <br /> and are to be considered as biological test machines by which the <br /> investigator may evaluate the protein-building worth of various pro- <br /> teins, amino acids, and protein mixtures incorporated in the diet. <br />  <br />                                       Methods <br />    In most respects the procedures used were the same as described in previous <br /> papers (8, 15, 13) from this laboratory. The dogs used had received the Laidlaw- <br /> Dunkin distemper prophylactic. They were kept in clean metabolism cages <br /> with water available at all times. Daily feedings, usually about 5 hours after <br /> plasmapheresis, were consumed voluntarily and well, except as noted in the clinical <br /> histories. Urine collections were strongly acidified with concentrated sulfuric <br /> acid and saved for weekly analysis. Despite precautions fecal contamination <br /> did occur and was removed as far as possible by filtration of the sample for analysis. <br />    The various diets are detailed in the dinical histories. In general the basal <br /> ration was calculated to contain 0.6 to 1 gin. protein and 70 to 80 calories per kilo <br /> of body weight. Most rations included cane sugar or corn syrup (Karo Blue <br /> <span id='am-4' about='rdfs:label' typeof='owl:Thing'>Label</span>), Vitavose (Squibb), lard or cottonseed oil or butter fat (the supernatant <br /> and filtered fat from melted creamery butter), and bone ash. All diets contained <br />                MADDEN~ WINSLOW~ HOWLAND~ AND WHIPPLE                              433 <br />  <br /> canned tomatoes, cod liver oil, and salt mixture (12)--without iron. The figures <br /> accepted for protein content of the various articles given in the diet are here given. <br /> Except as noted, the determinations were made in this laboratory by macro- <br /> Kjeldahl analysis and the protein calculated as 6.25 times the total nitrogen. <br /> Protein content: pork kidney, 16.2 per cent; pork liver, 20 per cent; canned <br /> salmon (total contents), 19 per cent; beef heart, 16 per cent; Vitavose, 8 per cent <br /> and 15 per cent; 1 canned tomato, 1.2 per cent; bran flakes (Post&apos;s), 13.2 per cent; <br /> boiled potato, 2.5 per cent; beef extract (Liebig), no protein&apos;but 9 per cent nitro- <br /> gen; 2 serum, concentrated (Lilly), 86 per cent; yeast (Fleischmann), 13 per cent; ~ <br /> dog red blood cells, 33 per cent; soy bean meal, 40 per cent; thyroid powder, <br /> U.S.P. (Armour), 41.5 per cent; rice polishings and beef stomach digest (Lilly), <br /> 31.7 per cent. All amino acids used were obtained from Eastman Kodak Com- <br /> pany; the specific ones were l-cystine, glycine, d-glutamic acid, tryptophane, and <br /> the dihydrochlorides of dl-lysine,/-histidine, and d-arginine. The rice polishings- <br /> beef stomach digest is the dried and defatted material obtained from acid digestion <br /> of equal parts of the fresh materials so concentrated that 1 gm. equals 1 gm. of <br /> each of the original substances. 1 gm. of the concentrated serum used contained <br /> the material obtained by alcoholic precipitation and drying of about 11 ml. of <br /> original serum. Liver extract (Lederle) &quot;for intramuscular use&quot; is said to contain <br /> in 1 ml. the active material from 100 gin. of fresh tissue. The soy bean meal <br /> used was light brown in color (7) and probably, though not certainly, of the same <br /> lot as that previously tested. We do not know how much heat was applied in <br /> the process of its preparation. All substances were fed as purchased with the <br /> following exceptions: the pork kidney and the beef heart were cooked in a double <br /> boiler and fed with the broth; the soy bean meal was cooked with water for 1 hour <br /> in a double boiler into a thick mush; pork liver was ground and fed raw; yeast <br /> was autoclaved for 15 minutes at 15 pounds steam pressure (256&#194;&#176;F.); dog red <br /> blood cells were washed in modified Locke&apos;s solution, measured when packed by <br /> centrifuging, and coagulated with mild heat; potatoes were boiled, peeled, and <br /> ground. All the components of the daily diet were thoroughly mixed together <br /> before feeding. For production of the sterile abscesses, spirits of turpentine <br /> (0.8 ml.) was injected subcutaneously into the lateral thoracic regions, using asep- <br /> tic precautions. <br />     The procedure of plasmapheresis was carried on as described (8) and modified <br /> (13) in previous reports from this laboratory. The chemical methods used also <br /> were the same as previously outlined with the following exceptions. Selenium <br /> dioxide (in solution, selenous acid) was used as catalyst in place of cupric sulfate <br /> in the macro-Kjeldahl digestion mixture (10). Total digestion time was thereby <br /> reduced to 75 minutes and distillation was facilitated by lessened foaming. The <br /> digestion mixture used contained concentrated sulfuric acid, 20 ml.; potassium <br /> sulfate, 10 gm., and selenium, 0.1 gm. (2 cc. of a 7 per cent solution of selenium <br />  <br />    1 As given by manufacturer for different lots. <br />      Determinations made in Department of Vital Economics. <br />  434              BLOOD PLASMA PROTEIN REGENERATION <br />  <br /> dioxide). Total nitrogen and albumin nitrogen of the plasma and total urinary <br /> nitrogen were all determined with this mixture. Half the quantity of selenium <br /> was used in determining plasma non-protein nitrogen, in which procedure tri- <br /> chloracetic acid was used to precipitate the protein (14). Nitrogen determina- <br /> tions on test food substances and plasma fractions were checked by the estab- <br /> lished method (using cupric sulfate as catalyst) and the results thus far obtained <br /> have indicated the shorter method (employing selenium) to be of equivalent <br /> accuracy. <br />     Since all plasma nitrogen determinations were made on samples from the <br /> pooled blood from each bleeding, in which samples saturated sodium citrate <br /> solution (1 part to 100 parts blood) was the only anticoagulant, all figures per- <br /> taining to circulating plasma nitrogen are low. When equal portions of the same <br /> blood are treated with isotonic sodium oxalate, 1.4 per cent (1 part to 5 parts <br /> blood), instead of saturated sodium citrate, it is found that the citrated plasma <br /> volume is from 3 per cent to 16 per cent greater than the oxalated, tending to vary <br /> directly as the oxalate hematocrits over the range from 40 per cent to 60 per cent. <br /> This indicated dilution by hypertonic sodium citrate and the known physiological <br /> dilution occurring during large bleedings both operate to produce lower concen- <br /> trations of elements in the pooled plasma than existed in the animal body. More- <br /> over, the shift of protein from plasma to corpuscles thought to occur upon addition <br /> of hyperosmotic solutions to blood in vitro (2) would tend further to reduce the <br /> plasma protein concentration as given. The figures for total grams of protein re- <br /> moved remain unaffeaed. <br />  <br />                        EXPERIM2ENTAL      OBSERVATIONS <br />  <br />    In the following tables and clinical histories are recorded the com- <br /> plete observations made on t w o dogs. In all instances, except the <br /> &quot;initial sample&quot; a t the start of each experiment, the figures are those <br /> of weekly totals or averages. A plasmapheresis was performed <br /> usually on 6 of the 7 days of each week, although sometimes this <br /> procedure on only 5 of the 7 days sufficed to maintain the average <br /> blood plasma concentration between 3.80 and 4.30 per cent for the <br /> period. During weeks of fasting or of sugar feeding, exchanges were <br /> less frequent, and in the experiments with chemical inflammation <br /> higher averages were maintained to insure against possible severe <br /> depressions of the plasma protein level. As defined in this laboratory, <br /> the potency ratio of a given substance means the n u m b e r of units of <br /> protein in this substance which are associated with the production of <br /> one <span id='am-1' about='Thesaurus:Unit' typeof='owl:Thing'>unit</span> of plasma protein. Obviously the lower the ratio the higher <br /> the potency. <br />              MADDEN, WINSLOW, HOWLAND, AND WHIPPLE                   435 <br />  <br />    In calculating nitrogen balance the weekly loss of nitrogen in feces <br /> of 2.7 gm. is based on a determination made during the previous <br /> work (13) on these dogs. Large factors in producing the total nega- <br /> tive balance for the period of observation are the nitrogen lag or carry <br /> over from the higher intake level of kennel diet and the nitrogen in <br /> the reserve store of plasma protein removed. <br />    In Tables 1 and 1-a are shown 25 weeks of experimentation on a dog <br /> (34-152) used successfully in a previously reported test period (13) of <br /> 21 weeks. During this former period the basal output averaged close <br /> to 12 gin. plasma protein per week and the reserve store, after 26 days <br /> on a basal diet followed by 1 week of dextrose feeding, amounted to <br /> only 10 gm. plasma protein. The first weeks in the present experi- <br /> ment offer a conspicuous contrast. Careful study of Table 1 indicates <br /> that the true basal output per week is 14 gm. plasma protein. It is <br /> obvious that this dog has a large reserve store of plasma protein- <br /> producing materials (56 gm. plasma protein above basal removed in <br /> the first 5 weeks). It requires 6 more weeks to remove all of this <br /> reserve store. In an attempt to explain this observation we may <br /> argue that the dog, on account of the experience with plasmapheresis <br /> the year previously, had developed greater capacity to conserve and <br /> retain tenaciously this reserve store of protein building material. <br /> This hypothesis will be tested in other animals. <br />    The potency ratios for the raw and cooked kidney (Table 1) obvi- <br /> ously cannot be determined accurately, as the reserve store has not <br /> been completely exhausted and contributes an uncertain amount to <br /> the protein output during such periods. <br />    Amino acids if given in proper mixtures should be well utilized to <br /> form plasma protein. Lysine is well represented in the plasma protein, <br /> but given alone with this basal ration it is inert. Lysine when given <br /> with histidine and arginine (3) does have a slight effect (Table 1, <br /> period 19) but only 3.7 gm. plasma protein are produced above the <br /> basal control level. <br />    Some observations on milk production in rats (5) suggested a trial <br /> of the combination of amino acids represented in glutathione. There <br /> does appear to be a definite increase in plasma protein output during <br /> and for 3 weeks following the feeding of cystine, glutamic acid, and <br /> glycine.

What fluctuations occurred in plasma volume <br /> and protein concentration favored a slight increase in the mass of <br /> circulating plasma protein. The animal gained more than 0.5 kg. <br /> in weight during this 4 weeks&apos; period and displayed a decrease in <br />  438              BLOOD    PLASMA    PROTEIN    REGENERATION <br />  <br />  <br /> urinary nitrogen. There was a positive nitrogen balance about <br /> equivalent to that noted after feeding 350 gin. cooked kidney. This <br /> all speaks for utilization of these amino acids in protein metabolism. <br /> In contrast, during the week of histidine, lysine, and arginine feeding <br />  (period 19) the urinary nitrogen increased almost to the amount of <br /> the excess nitrogen intake. <br />    The complication of spoon feeding was introduced in the 20th <br /> period because the dog refused its food. A period of fasting did not <br /> improve the appetite, although at all times the animal readily ate <br /> the diet when spoon fed. The fasting output (period 22) was appar- <br /> ently higher than usual, but on deducting 5.7 gin. accounted for by the <br /> conspicuous shrinkage of plasma volume, the usual output is noted. <br />    A digest of beef stomach and rice polishings (period 24, Table 1) <br /> displays an expected capacity for plasma protein production. Despite <br /> the fact that the experiment was terminated after 5 days of the second <br /> after period, a fairly high potency ratio (7.9) was already indicated. <br /> Too much weight cannot be given to this test of the rice polishings <br /> digest, as the subsequent acute fatal infection may have been develop- <br /> ing during this period. <br />    We note a sharp drop in the A / G ratio during the last four periods <br /> (Table 1). This drop frequently indicates trouble. Apparently the <br /> capacity to form albumin is more sensitive to harmful factors than is <br /> the capacity to produce globulin. During the last week of life a <br /> rapid sedimentation rate of the red cells was noted as a further index <br /> of trouble. <br />    The total negative nitrogen balance for the 25 weeks amounts to 90.6 <br /> gm. There is little weight loss. Obviously there has been a serious <br /> depletion of the essential protein matrix of the body cells, and this <br /> may well be an important influence in lowering resistance to bacterial <br /> infection. The red cell hematocrit showed no significant fall at any <br /> time, excluding anemia as a possible cause of lowered resistance in <br /> spite of all the bleeding. <br />    Clinical ttistory.--Dog 34-152 (Tables 1 and l-a). An adult male mongrel <br /> hound weighing 15.1 kg. had been previously tested over a period of 21 weeks (13) <br /> and had subsequently rested on kennel diet for 16 weeks. The dog was fasted <br /> during the 1st week except for the daily administration of 60 gin. dextrose in 200 <br /> ml. water by stomach tube. The basal daily diet then provided was the same <br />                MADDEN, WINSLOW, HOWLAND, AND BrI-IIPPLE                           439 <br />  <br /> as that used during the previous test period (13), except for a deduction of 10 gm. <br /> sugar and the addition of 7 gm. lard. It contained 50 gm. (raw weight) cooked <br /> pork kidney (8.1 gm. protein); 25 gin. canned tomato (0.3 gm. protein); 5 gin. <br /> Vitavose (0.4 to 0.75 gm. protein); 120 gin. cane sugar; 15 gm. cod liver oil; 37 grn. <br /> lard; 10 gin. butter fat; 5 gm. bone ash; 1 gm. salt mixture. This diet furnished <br /> about 75 calories per kilo body weight dally and had a bulk of 200 ml. The daily <br /> diet was voluntarily consumed 100 per cent until the middle of the 19th week. <br /> From then on much or all of the diet had to be spoon fed. This procedure met <br /> with no resistance and the food was swallowed 100 per cent. Except for some <br /> decrease in spontaneous activity, no change in the animal&apos;s clinical condition <br /> was detected at this time. With hope of stimulating the appetite and in view of a <br /> gradual weight gain, 10 gin. cod liver oil was deducted from the daily diet during <br /> the last 6 weeks. On one occasion only, the day before the end of the last re- <br /> corded week, an estimated 15 per cent of the day&apos;s diet was regurgitated. 2 days= <br /> later a rapid sedimentation rate of the blood drawn for sampling was noted. The <br /> plasma protein level on this day was 3.87 per cent. Outspoken signs of illness <br /> were absent at this time, although the dog did appear below par. Then followed <br /> a progressively rapid downhill course through irritability, stupor, and convulsions <br /> to death on the 5th day after the end of the 25th week. <br />    Autopsy disclosed acute vegetative endocarditis; focal acute myocarditis with <br /> abscess formation; acute suppurative nephritis; infected thrombus partially <br /> occluding left common iliac artery; bronchopneumonia; splenic infarct; cerebral <br /> hemorrhage; hemosiderin deposits in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and bone marrow. <br />    During the course of the experiment 8665 ml. of red blood cells were withdrawn <br /> and 10,092 ml. were returned suspended in modified Locke&apos;s solution containing <br /> a total of 541 gm. glucose. Weekly, non-protein nitrogen determinations varied <br /> from 15 to 25 rag. per cent during the entire period. The first supplement of <br /> kidney in period 6 was an accident and the amount of raw kidney was a little <br /> in excess of 400 gm. The second supplement of kidney was cooked and mixed <br /> with the basal ration over the 7 day period. The final supplement in Tables 1 <br /> and 1-a was a digest of beef stomach and rice polishings described under Methods. <br />  <br />     Tables 2 a n d 2-a present t h e results of satisfactory tests over a <br /> continuous period of 26 weeks.

Each 4.4 gin. of yeast protein resulted in the <br /> production of 1 gm. of plasma protein. The carry over into the week <br /> after feeding was equal to the output of the feeding week. <br />    Two attempts to get further information on a possible relationship <br /> of oral iron to plasma protein regeneration tend to deny a direct <br /> relationship. A previous test (15) adding 2 gm. ferric citrate (360 rag. <br /> iron) daily to a vegetable protein diet was accompanied by an excess <br /> protein output of 14.4 gin. but this was associated with anemia. This <br /> quantity is too large to be accounted for by any experimental variation <br /> such as blood volume fluctuation. In the present experiments during <br /> one period 1.15 gin. ferric citrate scales (200 rag. iron) in solution were <br /> given with 50 gm. dextrose daily by stomach tube (period 11, Table 2). <br /> The output of 9.8 gm. exceeds the expected fasting output but little, <br /> and the following week on basal diet yields less than the basal output. <br /> When the same amount of ferric citrate was added to the basal diet <br /> during period 17, the result was negative. <br />    A clinical observation reported to us (by Dr. D. J. Stephens) occa- <br /> sioned the trial of intramuscular liver extract. No effect on plasma <br /> protein regeneration was indicated. Oral liver extract enabled protein <br /> production in proportion to its protein content (15); the product for <br /> intramuscular use contained no protein. <br />    Proteins in red blood cells (about 95 per cent hemoglobin) have a low <br /> potency ratio of 10. Hemoglobin when fed to anemic dogs has a <br /> potency ratio of 10, that is, one must feed about 100 gm. hemoglobin <br /> to produce 10 gm. new hemoglobin in red cells (19). <br />    Dried serum, 1 gin. of which is obtained by alcoholic precipitation <br /> from about 11 ml. original serum, demonstrated excellent capacity for <br /> plasma protein production (potency ratio 3.5) despite some gastric <br /> disturbance, which in the following week resulted in the loss by vomit- <br /> ing of an amount estimated to equal 1 day&apos;s diet. A depression in <br /> plasma regeneration to a fasting level (period 21, Table 2) followed <br /> this upset and may have been due in part to the gastro-intestinal <br />              MADDEN, WINSLOW, HOWLAND, AND WHIPPLE                    443 <br />  <br /> disturbance. The change from salmon to kidney basal may have had <br /> an influence in the depression, or a slowly developing deficiency state <br /> may have become manifest. <br />    Soy bean meal (period 23, Table 2) retested at this time showed the <br /> expected prompt effect without carry over, but the total plasma pro- <br /> tein output was less than in a previous experiment (13). We have <br /> observed before that the potency ratio of a given food factor may <br /> remain unchanged or may show considerable change when tested with <br /> different basal diets. The soy bean meal with a kidney basal showed a <br /> potency ratio of 7.1 in contrast to this experiment with a salmon basal <br /> and potency ratio of 12.1. The soy bean feeding did favor a weight <br /> increase. A possible deficiency state may also have been a factor in <br /> this reaction. <br />    Thyroid powder given in large doses (period 25, Table 2) will accel- <br /> erate metabolism, and it was thought that such acceleration might <br /> increase or decrease plasma protein production, depending upon the <br /> site of action. As a matter of fact, there is no change in the picture <br /> and the protein of the thyroid powder is utilized just like any other <br /> protein, with a potency ratio of 5.3, indicating excellent utilization. <br /> It will be useful to know the reaction to thyroxin alone. <br />    During periods 27 to 31, Table 3, Dog 33-11 was progressing into a <br /> serious deficiency state due to inadequate protein intake and a steady <br /> drain on the plasma protein. The basal diet no longer enabled the <br /> dog to produce 12 gm. plasma protein each week. The dog had a dis- <br /> taste for food necessitating spoon feeding with occasional regurgita- <br /> tion, and there developed superficial ulcers on the skin over the gluteal <br /> regions. There was considerable loss of hair but no weight loss. <br /> There was a definitefall in the A/G ratio. <br />    The amino acid feeding (period 28, Table 3), gave no significant <br /> change in the plasma protein output, but this may be a false picture <br /> because of the deficiency state. The positive nitrogen balance sug- <br /> gests some utilization of some of these amino acids (compare period 14, <br /> Table l-a). <br />    Periods 37 and 39, Tables 3 and 3-a, present experiments on the <br /> effects of inflammation upon plasma protein regeneration.

The 37th period shows a marked <br /> depression of plasma protein regeneration and a conspicuous decline <br /> in the average blood plasma protein concentration accompanying <br />  446                 BLOOD PLASMA P R O T E I N R E G E N E R A T I O N <br />  <br />  <br /> the production of one turpentine abscess. The figures indicate a <br /> drop in protein output to 29 per cent of the output of the previous <br /> (36th) week but a part of this drop is due to a decreased food intake. <br /> In the second abscess period (39th period) the process was prolonged <br /> to a full week by the production of two consecutive abscesses (Clinical <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />       C~a_~TA. Plasmaprotein production depressedby turpentine abscess. <br /> History, Dog 33-11). Depression in plasma protein regeneration was <br /> marked (36.5 per cent of that for the 36th week), but not as great as <br /> that during the first abscess and the average circulating plasma protein <br /> level was higher. This elevation in output and the further relative <br /> elevation of the 40th week may indicate accumulation of undepleted <br />  <br />  <br /> protein a n d protein building materials during t h e 38th period, or m a y <br /> indicate a delayed o u t p u t based on protein building materials accum- <br /> ulated during t h e abscess periods themselves. The urinary nitrogen <br /> was distinctly elevated during the second abscess period and remained <br /> high during the final week on account of the hemoglobinuria (Clinical <br /> History, D o g 33-11). <br />  <br />     Clinical History.--Dog 33-11 (Tables 2 and 2-a, 3 and 3-a; Chart A). An <br /> adult female mongrel, born Nov. 25, 1932, in this laboratory, was raised on a <br /> salmon-bread-apricot diet. 2 months in the anemia colony were followed by <br /> 12 months on kennel diet. Its initiation to plasmapheresis continued only 5 weeks <br /> and has been reported (13). Some 16 weeks on kennel diet followed this depletion. <br /> Oct. 1, 1935, found the various initial determinations as given (Tables 2 and 2-a). <br /> During the 1st week 50 gm. dextrose in 150 ml. water were given daily by stomach <br /> tube. The kidney basal ration provided this dog was the same as that given <br /> Dog 34-152 (Table 1), except for reduction of cane sugar to 95 gin., lard to 30 <br /> grn., and cod liver oil to 10 gin. The salmon basal diets A and B were identical <br /> with the kidney basal ration, except for the substitution for the kidney of canned <br /> salmon, 20 gm. in A and 50 gln. in B. The latter daily diet contained 10.5 gin. <br /> protein and 926 calories. Weight was maintained and the diets were readily <br /> eaten. The yeast was weighed before autoclaving. In the llth week 25 ml. of <br /> 4.6 per cent solution of ferric citrate scales (Merck) (17.4 per cent iron) were <br /> added to the dextrose given daily as in the 1st week, and in the 17th period the <br /> same quantity of iron was added to the basal diet. The liver extract was given <br /> intramuscularly, 1 ml. each day. The gastro-intestinal disturbances from the <br /> 19th to the 29th weeks, apparently related to the feeding, have been mentioned <br /> above. Beef extract tried in the 25th period was unsuccessful in overcoming <br /> dishke for the diet. Spoon feeding was largely successful, although, as indicated <br /> in the figures for protein intake, food was sometimes lost by regurgitation. The <br /> non-protein nitrogen varied from 12 to 24 rag. per cent in the first 25 weeks and <br /> from 23 to 32 rag. per cent in the following 15 weeks. <br />     Upon changing in the 30th week to the potato-bran diet the dog voluntarily <br /> returned to 100 per cent food consumption for four days and then began to lose <br /> appetite. This diet contained 200 gm. boiled potato (5 gm. protein); 35 gm. <br /> bran flakes (4.6 gin. protein); 25 gin. tomato (0.3 gin. protein); 61 gin. corn syrup; <br /> 20 gm. cod liver oil; 20 gin. cottonseed oil; 1 gm. salt mixture. For 3 days in the <br /> 31st period 50 gm. beef heart (8.0 gin. protein) and 5 gin. Vitavose (0.75 gm. <br /> protein) were substituted in the above diet for the bran flakes, but still the response <br /> was poor. <br />    From the 1st day the dog ate the raw liver diet avidly. Within 3 weeks the <br /> sores on the buttocks were completely healed and loss of hair appeared much re- <br /> duced. The first liver diet consisted of 100 gm. raw liver (20 gm. protein); 10 gm. <br /> Vitavose; 50 gin. tomato; 94 gm. cane sugar; 20 gin. cod liver oil; 20 gin. cotton- <br />  448              BLOOD PLASMA       PROTEIN 1LEGENERATION <br />  <br /> seed oil; 15 gin. bone ash; 1 gin. salt mixture. The B modification reduced the <br /> liver to 75 gm. and increased the sugar to 102 gin., maintaining a total caloric <br /> value of 903. The C modification maintained the same protein kind and quan- <br /> tity but reduced the caloric value to 800, and arrested the gradual weight increase. <br /> The animal maintained a good clinical condition despite the abscess production, <br /> although during these periods it frequently left a small amount of its diet and <br /> rarely regurgitated a small quantity. <br />     To produce a sterile abscess turpentine was injected on the right side on the <br /> last day of the 36th period. Leucocyte count was 12,000 before injection and <br /> 56,000 2 days after. Rectal temperature was 41.3&#194;&#176;C. ~ hour following plasma- <br /> pheresis on the 1st day of the 37th period, but fell to 38.9&#194;&#176;C. within 4 hours. <br /> The remaining 4 days of the period were without fever or plasmapheresis. On the <br /> 3rd day the local swelling was fluctuant and on the 4th day the abscess was <br /> drained by incision. 80 ml. of sanguineous seropurulent material were obtained. <br /> The leucocyte count dropped to 14,800 on this day. Culture of the abscess <br /> material produced no bacterial growth. The following day similar but thinner <br /> fluid, about 35 ml., was removed. Turpentine was evident in all this material, <br /> as well as in 17 ml. similar material aspirated 2 days later after the wound had <br /> closed. On this day, the 2nd of the 38th period, the leucocyte count rose to <br /> 39,400 and the temperature climbed to 40.2&#194;&#176;C. shortly after plasmapheresis but <br /> dropped to 38&#194;&#176; less than 4 hours later. During the balance of the period the <br /> leucocyte count averaged 25,000and the rectal temperature did not exceed 38.2&#194;&#176;C. <br />     A second abscess was produced with turpentine on the left side on the last <br /> day of this period (period 38). Fluctuation in the abscess appeared on the 3rd <br /> day of the period and another turpentine injection was made on the right side. <br /> On the 5th day the second abscess was drained, yielding 77 ml. seropurulent <br /> material and on the 7th day 82 ml. of material was obtained from the third abscess. <br /> The leucocyte count reached 53,400 on the 5th day and the temperature 39.8&#194;&#176;C. <br /> Both of these abscesses healed without further accumulation of fluid, and the <br /> leucocyte count gradually dropped to 11,200 by the last day of the 40th period. <br /> During the last period transitory pyrexia as high as 40.1&#194;&#176;C. would sometimes <br /> appear after plasmapheresis, without any recognizable general disturbance. <br />     On the 2nd day of the last period the red cells (131 ml.) prepared for injection <br /> were accidentally much overheated, then subsequently cooled to body temperature <br /> and injected. Hemoglobinuria was noted within 1 hour and few hours later slight <br /> icterus of sclerae and mucous membranes could be detected. No general dis- <br /> turbance in the behavior of the dog was recognized at any time, although part of <br /> the diet was refused for 2 days. <br />     The dog was continued on the same diet for 14 days following the discontinu- <br /> ance of plasmapheresis at the dose of the 40th period. On the 1st day the blood <br /> plasma protein concentration was 4.45 gm. per 100 ml. plasma; the 4th day it had <br /> risen to 4.68, the 8th day to 4.80, and the 14th day to 5.87. <br />              ~&amp;ADDEN, WINSLOW, HOWLAND, AND WHIPPLE                   449 <br />  <br />                               DISCUSSION <br />    Infection and its influence on plasma protein production invite <br /> discussion. The &quot;sterile abscess&quot; due to turpentine gives the complete <br /> clinical picture of a bacterial abscess--inflammation, fever, leucocy- <br /> tosis, localized pus formation, and an increased urinary nitrogen. <br /> Moreover, it can be promptly terminated on the 3rd or 4th day, with <br /> subsequent rapid healing. Chart A shows that the sterile abscess <br /> causes a diminution in the production of new plasma protein during <br /> the abscess week. A small part of this initial reaction can be ex- <br /> plained by extravasation at the site of the abscess and in the first <br /> abscess period the slight decrease in protein intake will explain a small <br /> part. The larger part is yet to be explained. We might argue that <br /> materials which would go to form the plasma proteins were deviated <br /> to repair the body tissues whose injury released the customarily <br /> noted (4) excess urinary nitrogen. One might also argue that the <br /> protein-forming mechanism (in the liver?) is disturbed by the abscess <br /> intoxication slowing up plasma protein formation. In the anemic <br /> dog this last thesis has been shown to obtain for the inhibition of <br /> hemoglobin formation caused by a sterile abscess (17). <br />    Reserve stores of materials which can promptly be converted into <br /> plasma proteins have been demonstrated in dogs. The amount of <br /> such stores depends in part on the diets of the preceding weeks. It <br /> would seem (Tables 1 and 2) that dogs which have been through <br /> periods of depletion by plasmapheresis, tend to heap up greater reserve <br /> stores of plasma protein building materials during intervening rest <br /> periods. Where these reserve stores are located is of some interest, <br /> and there seems to be no reasonable doubt that a part at least is stored <br /> in the liver but the liver cannot possibly hold all such large reserve <br /> stores as demonstrated in some dogs. The reserve store may amount <br /> to more protein than is contained in the entire liver and we may <br /> suspect the muscles as another possible depot (1). Addis and asso- <br /> dates (1) and Luck (11) have given evidence for &quot;liver storage of <br /> proteins related to diet. <br />    Albumin-globulin ratios are much talked about but they scarcely <br /> deserve this attention. There is always the uncertainty about the <br />  450            BLOOD PLASMA P R O T E I N R E G E N E R A T I O N <br />  <br />  <br /> separation of albumin and globulin into distinct fractions. Some <br /> methods used will give gross inaccuracies. A favorite argument is <br /> that a drop in the A/G ratio indicates a ~decreased albumin production <br /> and that the particular tissue concerned in the injury reaction is <br /> therefore responsible for the manufacture of the albumin of the plasma. <br /> For example Dalla Volta (18) notes a fall in the A/G ratio after <br /> x-ray injury of the bone marrow and like many others argues that the <br /> albumin is formed in the red marrow. Any considerable disturbance <br /> of the normal state in the dog will show a drop in the A / G ratio and a <br /> diet rich in some grain proteins will likewise cause a drop in the A / G <br /> ratio (13). Of the plasma proteins the fibrinogen is most labile and <br /> can be raised or lowered by a great variety of body changes (6). <br /> Albumin appears to be more labile than globulin and certainly escapes <br /> from the circulation more readily than does the larger globulin mole- <br /> cule--a good example is nephrosis with escape of albumin in the urine. <br /> Certain proteins in the food favor albumin production--for example <br /> muscle, liver, kidney, soy bean meal. In the present unsatisfactory <br /> state of our knowledge too much weight cannot be placed safely upon <br /> the interesting fluctuations of the albumin and globulin in the plasma. <br />    The potency ratio as used in our papers means the grams of protein <br /> fed which will yield 1 gin. of new plasma protein in these depleted <br /> dogs. Potency ratios may vary depending upon a number of factors. <br /> The basal diet is probably most important as all our basal rations <br /> contain some protein which might be capable of supplementing an <br /> added protein (e.g. liver) but the protein of another basal ration might <br />  not act favorably. Presumably the new plasma protein results from <br />  the assembly of many amino acids and other materials (in the liver?) <br />  and the amount and character of the amino acids coming from one <br />  basal diet might determine the reaction with the amino acids coming <br />  from some accessory food protein. It is probable also that these <br />  dogs can utilize relatively small amounts of added protein more effi- <br />  ciently than larger supplements. The potency ratio would then rise <br />  as larger amounts of the food protein were added. The caloric intake <br />  may also be a factor. On a given diet it is probable that some dogs <br />  can make plasma protein more efficiently than others just as some dogs <br />  can make hemoglobin in anemia more efficiently on a given diet as <br />  compared with certain other dogs. Similar variations apply to <br />                     MADDEN, WINSLOW, HOWLAND, AND WHIPPLE                                                 451 <br />  <br /> endurance, speed of running, resistance to infection, and other individ- <br /> ual qualities. Obviously the potency ratio must be interpreted <br /> cautiously with understanding of all the conditions of the experiment, <br /> realizing that apparently insignificant variables may cause sizable <br /> differences in reaction. To show the potency ratio of liver we refer <br /> to Table 4 illustrating relatively stable potency ratios in different dogs <br /> under a variety of conditions. <br />    Raw liver was given in Table 3 and this potency ratio of 5.5 may <br /> mean a more complete utilization of the uncooked tissue. On the <br /> other hand this dog was emerging from a deficiency state and may <br /> have been utilizing this protein at an even greater pace than during <br /> other more normal periods. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />    Gastro-intestinal disturbances are obviously important in this type <br /> of experiment and this was to be expected. Fresh yeast causes <br /> diarrhea and intestinal disturbance without obvious clinical intoxica- <br /> tion but with a great fall in the plasma protein output. There is a <br /> conspicuous difference in the utilization of autoclaved yeast, which is <br /> well digested and gives a potency ratio of about 4.4. The fresh yeast <br /> caused a fall of plasma protein production to the fasting level (Table <br /> 5, Reference 13). Likewise in Dog 33-11 (Table 2, period 21) there <br /> was some gastro-intestinal disturbance which was probably in part <br /> responsible for this fall in the plasma protein output to a fasting level. <br />   Amino acids in plasma depletion experiments cannot fail to intrigue <br /> the investigator. Theoretically it should be possible with the proper <br />  452            BLOOD PLASMA P R O T E I N R E G E N E R A T I O N <br />  <br />  <br /> mixture of amino acids to influence profoundly the plasma protein <br /> production. Such good fortune as yet has not been attained by our <br /> few experiments. A combination of cystine, glutamic acid, and <br /> glycine by mouth does have a slight influence on new plasma protein <br /> production and shows a positive nitrogen balance in this dog (Table 1). <br /> Much more work in this field is badly needed. <br />   Iron when given with a potato-bran basal diet (15) in the presence <br /> of a moderate anemia did appear to have a definite influence upon <br /> plasma protein regeneration. When iron is given with a salmon basal <br /> diet or during fasting with a normal hemoglobin concentration (Table <br /> 2) there is no effect upon the plasma protein production. We cannot <br /> give any adequate explanation for this difference in the action of iron <br /> but hope to report in more detail later. <br />                                   SUMMARY <br />  <br />    When blood plasma proteins are depleted by bleeding, with return <br /> of washed red cells (plasmapheresis), it is possible to bring dogs to a <br /> steady state of low plasma protein in the circulation and a uniform <br /> plasma protein production on a basal diet. Such dogs become test <br /> subjects by which the effect of various factors on plasma protein <br /> regeneration can be measured. <br />    Dogs previously the subjects of plasmapheresis, during long rest <br /> periods appear to increase their stores of plasma protein building mate- <br /> rials and their blood plasma protein concentrations above former <br /> normal levels. <br />    A sterile abscess (turpentine) induces a marked reduction in plasma <br /> protein regeneration in these test dogs consuming an ample basal diet. <br /> The sharp reduction during the initial 24 hours may in part reflect <br /> an extravasation of plasma protein into the injured tissue but there <br /> also appears to develop a true disturbance of the mechanism which <br /> produces plasma proteins. <br />    Digestive disturbances interfere seriously with plasma protein <br /> production. Whereas large quantities of live yeast upset digestion <br /> and form no plasma protein, autoclaved yeast is well utilized, having a <br /> potency ratio of 4.4. <br />    Amino acids have been tested inadequately. A mixture of cystine, <br />                 ~LADDEN, WINSLOW, J~OWLAND~ AND WHIPPLE                       453 <br />  <br /> glutamic acid, and glycine does seem to have a definite effect upon <br /> protein metabolism and plasma protein production. <br />    Iron, under the conditions of these experiments, does not influence <br /> the output of plasma proteins. Liver extract (parenteral) is also <br /> inert. <br />    The proteins of red blood cells when added to the diet are poorly <br /> utilized for plasma protein formation and show a potency ratio of <br /> only 10.1. <br />    Kidney protein added to the kldney basal diet shows a potency ratio <br /> of about 5 as compared with 4.6 for that basal diet. <br />    A digest of beef stomach and rice polishings shows a potency ratio <br /> of about 7.9. Dried powdered serum shows a potency ratio of 3.5, <br /> which is much less than fresh serum (2.6). <br />    Powdered thyroid fed in doses sufficient to accelerate body metab- <br /> olism shows no distinct effect upon plasma protein production not <br /> attributable to the protein in the thyroid powder itself. <br />    Long periods (25 to 30 weeks) of plasma depletion and basal diet <br /> intake remove much protein from body fluids and tissues. Associated <br /> with this protein depletion the dog loses its appetite and may vomit <br /> some food. There is loss of hair, a tendency to skin ulceration, and a <br /> distinct lowering of resistance to infection. The plasma protein <br /> output may fall to fasting levels in spite of food intake sufficient to <br /> maintain weight. We believe this condition to be a deficiency state <br /> related to severe depletion of the essential protein matrix of the body <br /> cells. <br />   <br /> </body></html>
