Introduction <br />                                                 Nod1 plays an important role in innate immunity as a cytoplasmic <br />                                                 sensor of microbial components derived <span id='am-3' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> cell-wall peptidoglycan <br />  <br />                                                 (PGN; Girardin et al., 2003). Recently, it has also been shown that <br />  <br />                                                 polymorphisms of the Nod1 gene are associated with inflammatory <br />                                                 bowel disease (McGovern et al., 2005) and asthma (Hysi et al., 2005). <br />                                                 In addition, Nod1 is also involved in host defense against Helico- <br />                                                 bacter pylori infection, which can cause peptic ulcers and gastric <br />                                                 cancer (Viala et al., 2004). The Nod1 molecule consists of three <br />                                                 domains. The C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain is <br />                                                 responsible for the recognition of bacterial PGN. The middle <br />                                                 nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) facilitates <br />                                                 self-oligomerization of Nod1, while the N-terminal caspase-recruit- <br />                                                 ment domain (CARD) interacts with other downstream signaling <br />                                                 proteins that also possess CARD modules [including, for example, <br />                                                 receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) and caspase-1]. The recognition <br />                                                 of bacterial PGN initiates the oligomerization-driven activation <br />                                                 process of Nod1. Subsequently, activated Nod1 can recruit RIP2 or <br />                                                 caspase-1 through the homotypic CARD&#226;&#8364;&#8220;CARD interaction. The <br />                                                 interaction of Nod1 with RIP2 activates a transcription factor NF- B <br />                                                 and induces the expression of genes involved in immune response <br />                                                 (Inohara et al., 2000). Nod1 interaction with caspase-1 leads to the <br />                                                 production of IL-1  (Yoo et al., 2002). However, the molecular <br />                                                 mechanisms through which Nod1 activates the innate immune <br />                                                 response are not fully understood. <br />                                                    The 80-amino-acid CARD possesses a death-domain fold which is <br />                                                 formed by six  -helices (Weber &amp; Vincenz, 2001). Like other <br />                                                 members of the death-domain superfamily, such as the death domain, <br />                                                 the death-effector domain and the pyrin domain, CARD mediates <br />                                                 homotypic interactions in which the CARD of one protein interacts <br />                                                 with a similar CARD module of another protein. Since many CARD- <br />                                                 containing proteins have been identified as important players in the <br />                                                 innate immune response, structural and functional insight into the <br />                                                 CARD&#226;&#8364;&#8220;CARD interaction is critical to understand the molecular <br />                                                 mechanisms of this initial immune response. <br />                                                    Crystal structures of the monomeric CARDs of Apaf-1 (Vaughn et <br />                                                 al., 1999) and caspase-9 (Qin et al., 1999) and NMR structures of the <br />                                                 monomeric CARDs of RAIDD (Chou et al., 1998) and ICEBERG <br />                                                 (Humke et al., 2000) are available in the PDB and only one crystal <br />                                                 structure of a heterodimeric complex (Apaf-1 and caspase-9) has <br /> # 2007 International Union of Crystallography   been determined (Qin et al., 1999).

X-ray data collection and X-ray analysis                      <br />    X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.9 A&#203;&#353; at 100 K on beamline     <br /> F2 at MacCHESS (Fig. 2). The data were processed with the HKL-                <br /> 2000 program suite (Otwinowski &amp; Minor, 1997). The native crystals     <br /> belong to space group P31 or P32, with <span id='am-8' about='Thesaurus:Unit' typeof='owl:Thing'>unit</span>-cell parameters a = b = 79.1,   <br />          &#203;&#353; .

Results and discussion                                                  <br /> Gel-filtration experiments showed that Nod1_CARD underwent                <br /> concentration-dependent dimerization, with a mainly dimeric                <br /> conformation at the concentration used for crystallization (Fig. 3).      <br /> Solvent-content analysis showed that the volume of the asymmetric         <br /> unit of the crystal was compatible with one molecule of dimeric              <br /> Nod1_CARD. The corresponding Matthews coefficient was                          <br />      &#203;&#353; 3 Da 1, with 56.2% solvent content.
