We investigated Escherichia coli cell elongation and division, as well as the <br />          dynamics of chromosome replication and segregation, in the presence of sublethal concentrations of amikacin <br />          (AMK). The fates of the chromosome ori and ter loci were monitored by visualization by using derivatives of <br />          LacI and TetR fused to fluorescent proteins in E. coli strains that carry operator arrays at the appropriate <br />          locations. The results showed that cultures containing sublethal concentrations of AMK contained abnormally <br />          elongated cells. The chromosomes in these cells were properly located, suggesting that the dynamics of <br />          replication and segregation were normal. FtsZ, an essential protein in the process of cell division, was studied <br />          by using an ectopic FtsZ-cyan fluorescent protein fusion.

Niki, <br /> personal communication). <br />  <br />  <br />                    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <br />    Low AMK concentrations affect cell physiology without sig- <br /> nificantly interfering with viability. We initiated a project to <br /> study the effects of AMK on different E. coli cellular processes <br /> while the cells were growing in liquid minimal medium. To <br /> discriminate the cell processes most susceptible to the action of <br /> AMK, we used conditions of a slow growth rate and AMK <br /> concentrations that did not significantly affect the growth or <br /> viability of the cells. AMK concentrations exceeding 16 &#226;&#65533;&#174;g/ml <br /> resulted in the quick loss of viability, as determined by OD600 <br /> determination and plating on L agar after 8 h of incubation. <br /> However, at lower AMK concentrations (4 &#226;&#65533;&#174;g/ml), growth <br /> continued after 14 h of incubation (late logarithmic phase) <br /> (Fig. 1A), and the plating efficiency on L agar showed that <br /> there was no significant loss of viability within this time. How- <br /> ever, the sizes and the numbers of colonies on 4 &#226;&#65533;&#174;g/ml AMK- <br /> containing L-agar plates after overnight incubation were re- <br /> duced compared to those of colonies growing on plain L-agar <br /> plates, indicating that there is a deleterious effect that can be <br /> detected after a higher number of generations. <br />    Figure 1B shows a comparison of cells grown in the absence <br /> and the presence of 4 &#226;&#65533;&#174;g/ml AMK. In both cases nucleoids can <br /> be observed as light masses, but granular bodies at the poles <br /> are only seen in the presence of the antibiotic. We suspect that <br /> these granular bodies, reminiscent of inclusion bodies, are <br /> proteinaceous (8), but we do not know if they contain one or <br /> more proteins. Almost all cells in the cultures containing 4 <br /> &#226;&#65533;&#174;g/ml AMK possessed the granular bodies. These results sug- <br /> gest that although 4 &#226;&#65533;&#174;g/ml AMK is a sublethal concentration, <br /> it is enough to interfere with proper protein translation.

Important advances in the under-                                <br /> standing of molecular interactions and mechanisms of action                          <br /> have been made with the resolution of the crystal structures of                      <br /> complexes between aminoglycoside molecules and rRNA or                               <br /> oligonucleotides (4&#226;&#8364;&#8220;7, 17, 23, 26). We have started a program                            <br /> that uses a cell biology approach to understand how aminogly-                    <br /> cosides affect different cellular processes within bacteria. Our                           <br /> data show that not all cellular processes are equally susceptible                    <br /> to the action of AMK. Cell division was affected by sublethal     <br /> concentrations of AMK, while the chromosomal dynamics                               <br /> seemed to be more resilient. In the presence of sublethal AMK            <br /> concentrations, replication as well as segregation of the ori and                        <br /> the ter loci seemed to be unaffected. We showed here that this                          <br /> approach might be an important tool in the clarification of the                      <br /> mechanisms of action of aminoglycosides at the cellular level.         <br />   <br /> </body></html>
