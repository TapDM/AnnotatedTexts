In mammals, it also functions as a hepatotrophic growth factor that specifically stimulates <br />      hepatocyte proliferation and promotes liver regeneration after liver damage or partial hepatectomy. Whether ALR also plays <br />      a role during vertebrate hepatogenesis is unknown. In this work, we investigated the function of alr in liver organogenesis <br />      in zebrafish model. We showed that alr is expressed in liver throughout hepatogenesis. Knockdown of alr through <br />      morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MO) leads <span id='am-5' about='protege:TO' typeof='owl:Thing'>to</span> suppression of liver outgrowth while overexpression of alr promotes <br />      liver growth.

Knockdown of alr by antisense morpholino oligonucleotide inhibits liver growth. A. Schematic presentation of alr pre-mRNA <br /> and morpholino design. alr pre-mRNA consists of 3 exons (shown by squares) and 2 introns (shown by lines). The number of nucleotides in each <br /> region is labeled below the region. The red lines indicate the targeting sites of the two splicing inhibiting morpholinos, E1I1 and I1E2. In 5-bp <br /> mismatch control morpholino injected embryos (CO), splicing of alr pre-mRNA is not affected. In E1I1 morpholino injected embryos, two alternative <br /> splicing sites are used. One of the alternative splicing sites is at 229 bp downstream of the 59 boarder of intron 1, generating mRNA product a; the <br /> other alternative splicing site is in exon 1, 160 bp downstream of the 59 end of exon 1, producing the mRNA product b. In I1E2 morphants, E1I1 <br /> splicing site and I2E3 splicing site will join together and generate mRNA c (with exon 2 removed). The red arrows show the stop codons present in <br /> these alternatively spliced mRNAs. B.
