The Prp2 protein hydrolyzes ATP and is required for the <br /> first reaction (Yean SL, Lin RJ, 1991, Mol Cell Biol 11:5571-5577; Kim SH, Smith J, Claude A, Lin RJ, 1992, EMBO <br /> J 11:2319-2326). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SPP2 gene was previously identified as a high-copy suppres- <br /> sor of temperature-sensitive prp2 mutants (Last RL, Maddock JR, Woolford JL Jr, 1987, Genetics 117:619-631). <br /> We have characterized the function of Spp2p in vivo and in vitro. Spp2p is an essential protein required for the <br /> first RNA cleavage reaction in vivo. Depletion of Spp2p <span id='am-2' about='protege:FROM' typeof='owl:Thing'>from</span> yeast cells results in accumulation of unspliced <br /> pre-mRNAs. A temperature-sensitive spp2-1 mutant accumulates pre-mRNAs in vivo and is unable to undergo <br /> the first splicing reaction in vitro. However, spliceosomal complexes are assembled in extracts prepared from <br /> the mutant. We show that Spp2p function is required after spliceosome assembly but prior to the first reac- <br /> tion. Spp2p associates with the spliceosome before the first RNA cleavage reaction and is likely to be released <br /> from the spliceosome following ATP hydrolysis by Prp2p. The Prp2 and Spp2 proteins are capable of physi- <br /> cally interacting with each other. These results suggest that Spp2p interacts with Prp2p in the spliceosome <br /> prior to the first cleavage-ligation reaction. Spp2p is the first protein that has been found to interact with a <br /> DEAD/H box splicing factor. <br /> Keywords: physical interaction; pre-mRNA processing; Saccharomyces cerevisiae <br />  <br />  <br /> INTRODUCTION                                                                  also required for proper assembly and function of the <br /> The removal of introns from nuclear messenger RNA                             spliceosome. <br /> precursors (splicing) takes place by two trans-esteri-                           It is widely believed that, as with group I and group <br /> fication reactions, involving cleavage and ligation,                          II introns, pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by RNA. <br /> within a complex ribonucleoprotein particle called the                        Spliceosome assembly relies heavily on dynamic RNA- <br /> spliceosome (for recent reviews, see Rymond &amp; Ros-                            RNA and RNA-protein interactions that occur in a <br /> bash, 1992; Moore et al., 1993; Legrain &amp; Chanfreau,                          temporal fashion to result in a productive splicing re- <br /> 1994).
