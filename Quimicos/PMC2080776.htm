Principal Findings. investigated question examining additional effects DR wildtype animals daf-2 mutants moderate severe IIS deficits. Surprisingly, DR IIS opposing effects physiological <br /> processes.  DR induced stress-related change intestinal vesicle trafficking, termed response, suppressed daf-2 mutants.
