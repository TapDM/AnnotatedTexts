Blumenthal* <br /> Department Biological Sciences, Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States America <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />      Abstract <br />      Mutations gene drop-dead (drd) cause diverse phenotypes adult Drosophila melanogaster including early lethality, <br />      neurodegeneration, tracheal defects, gut dysfunction, reduced body mass, female sterility. Despite identification      drd gene itself, causes early lethality neurodegeneration mutant flies remain unknown. determine <br />      pattern drd expression associated neurodegenerative phenotype, knockdown drd various Gal4 <br />      drivers performed. Early adult lethality neurodegeneration observed knockdown drd tracheal <br />      independent insertions breathless-Gal4 driver knockdown tracheal      DJ717-Gal4 driver. Surprisingly, rescue drd expression exclusively tracheae mutant <br />      flies rescued neurodegenerative phenotype adult lethality. Gut dysfunction, measured defecation rate, <br />      rescued flies, gut function appeared normal tracheal-specific knockdown drd. Finally,      hypothesis tracheal dysfunction drd mutants results hypoxia tested. Hypoxia-sensitive reporter transgenes <br />      (LDH-Gal4 LDH-LacZ) placed drd mutant background, enhanced expression reporters      observed. addition, manipulation drd expression tracheae did affect expression hypoxia-induced <br />      genes LDH, tango, similar. Overall, results indicate causes adult lethality drd <br />      mutants, gut dysfunction neurodegeneration independent phenotypes, neurodegeneration      associated tracheal expression drd hypoxia. <br />  <br />   Citation: Sansone CL, Blumenthal EM (2013) Neurodegeneration Drop-Dead Mutant Drosophila melanogaster Associated Respiratory   Hypoxia.
